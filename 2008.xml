<p>Was Bush 43 the worst president of the last 50 years? Nixon resigned over the Watergate scandal. Carter lost the battle against stagflation. Bush took us to war in Iraq over weapons of mass destruction that didn’t exist, but he kept the nation safe after 9/11. Will history look upon his presidency favorably?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Enemies? Frenemies? Debate on China-US Ties Concludes That War Isn't Imminent</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A former prime minister of Australia, a political science professor, and two senior members from United States-based think-tanks took turns at the lectern at a packed auditorium in Kaufman Music Center on Oct. 14 to debate a topic of the times: are China and the United States long-term enemies?</p></div>
<div><strong>Sino-US Ties: Prospects for Cooperation not Confrontation</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a debate held by "Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.", renowned international relations experts such as John J. Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies. The opinion poll of audiences that followed shows that 56 percent of those on site and 64 percent of those on-line said "no".</p></div>

<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p>Soon after Google was founded, it adopted a corporate motto: don’t be evil. Since then, it has been the dominant curator of digital information, cornered the market on private email, and made personal information publicly available in unprecedented fashion. While it provides critical social and economic services for free, it has amassed enormous power over information exchange around the world. Has Google violated its “don’t be evil” motto?</p>

<p>Arguing for the resolution are author Joe Konrath and journalist Matthew Yglesias. Arguing against are author Scott Turow and Franklin Foer, former editor of The New Republic. Heres whats happening & brvbar</p></div>
<div><strong>Amazon and Its Friends</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>During the 2012 campaign, Mitt Romney made an off-the-cuff comment about how corporations are people. He was mocked but perhaps was ahead of his time. A few years later, corporations are not only people but our friends.</p>
<p>Forget about same-day delivery of diapers reconnecting with your high school girlfriend or publishing those novels without the aid of an editor or bookstore. The greatest achievement of Silicon Valley has been the marketing of Silicon Valley. Google, Apple, and Facebook 'all assert they exist for your benefit, their only goal to amuse and enlighten, and help you. To be, in short, your best buddy.</p>
<p>The tech world's devotion to its customers was put to a vote this month in Manhattan, at one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. series of debates. The evening's topic: Amazon is the reader's friend.</p>
<p>For those nostalgic for last year's clash between Amazon and Hachette, the debate ' expertly moderated by the ABC news correspondent John Donvan ' replayed the brawl. The self-published novelist Joe Konrath and the Vox editor Matthew Yglesias argued in favor of the proposition; the novelist Scott Turow and the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer argued against it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Smart Technology Making Us Dumb? Take Our Poll.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I attended a recent Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate at the Kaufman Center in New York City on this question: Does smart technology make us dumb?</p>
<p>Two sets of panelists argued pro and con in front of a sold-out crowd. The audience was an integral part of the evening because it voted on who won the debate. After listening to both sides, how would you vote? Take our poll at the end of this story to tell us.</p></div>
<div><strong>News Formats Change, But the Content Stays the Same</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I recently attended an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate over whether 'smart technology is making us dumb.' Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Tech</p>
<p>Soon after Google was founded, it adopted a corporate motto: don’t be evil. Since then, it has been the dominant curator of digital information, cornered the market on private email, and made personal information publicly available in unprecedented fashion. While it provides critical social and economic services for free, it has amassed enormous power over information exchange around the world. Has Google violated its “don’t be evil” motto?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>I took a wrong turn on the subway and reached Brooklyn before I realized I was a long way from the Kaufman Center in Manhattan. I arrived late at the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on the resolution Amazon is the Readers Friend.</p>
<p>We are now into questions from the audience. Its been a fantastic discussion, organized in classic debate style with some innovations introduced by the steady, savvy moderator, John Donvan.</p>
<p>Arguing for the resolution are author Joe Konrath and journalist Matthew Yglesias. Arguing against are author Scott Turow and Franklin Foer, former editor of The New Republic. Heres whats happening & brvbar</p></div>
<div><strong>Amazon and Its Friends</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>During the 2012 campaign, Mitt Romney made an off-the-cuff comment about how corporations are people. He was mocked but perhaps was ahead of his time. A few years later, corporations are not only people but our friends.</p>
<p>Forget about same-day delivery of diapers reconnecting with your high school girlfriend or publishing those novels without the aid of an editor or bookstore. The greatest achievement of Silicon Valley has been the marketing of Silicon Valley. Google, Apple, and Facebook 'all assert they exist for your benefit, their only goal to amuse and enlighten, and help you. To be, in short, your best buddy.</p>
<p>The tech world's devotion to its customers was put to a vote this month in Manhattan, at one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. series of debates. The evening's topic: Amazon is the reader's friend.</p>
<p>For those nostalgic for last year's clash between Amazon and Hachette, the debate ' expertly moderated by the ABC news correspondent John Donvan ' replayed the brawl. The self-published novelist Joe Konrath and the Vox editor Matthew Yglesias argued in favor of the proposition; the novelist Scott Turow and the former New Republic editor Franklin Foer argued against it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Smart Technology Making Us Dumb? Take Our Poll.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I attended a recent Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate at the Kaufman Center in New York City on this question: Does smart technology make us dumb?</p>
<p>Two sets of panelists argued pro and con in front of a sold-out crowd. The audience was an integral part of the evening because it voted on who won the debate. After listening to both sides, how would you vote? Take our poll at the end of this story to tell us.</p></div>
<div><strong>News Formats Change, But the Content Stays the Same</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I recently attended an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate over whether 'smart technology is making us dumb.' Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>

<p>Does widespread gun ownership prevent crimes by empowering law-abiding citizens? Or does normalized gun presence make violent crime more likely, and encourage untrained civilians to take the law into their own hands?  Do guns reduce crime?</p>

<div><strong>Common Core Revisited</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On September 9, I attended the NPR-syndicated Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "Should Schools Embrace the Common Core?" Although it has been reported that close to 80 percent of Americans now oppose the Common Core Standards, the initial poll of the live audience showed that 50 percent of the audience was for, 13 percent against, and 37 percent undecided. So one obvious question is: How much of the audience was made up of people who had some skin in the Common Core game?</p></div>
<div><strong>Leveled Reading: The Making of a Literacy Myth</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>New York public school principal Carol Burris, an outspoken standards critic, and defender of leveled reading, recently published an anti-Common Core missive on the Washington Post's Answer Sheet blog that was fairly typical of the form. Where, she wondered, is the research to support: close reading, increased Lexile levels, the use of informational texts, and other questionable practices in the primary grades?</p>
<p>The blog post, which has already been intelligently critiqued by Ann Whalen at Education Post, expanded on remarks delivered by Burris earlier this month at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate with Fordham president Michael Petrilli and former assistant secretary of education Carmel Martin. There, too, she demanded evidence of literacy improvements arising from the use of complex texts.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Core of the Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A recent debate, Embrace the Common Core? hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., featured some of the nation's top experts on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The Oxford-style 2 vs. 2 debate show included comments on topics such as whether or not the CCSS is actually right for kids and the rationale behind national standards. In particular, the debate focused on the controversial CCSS-aligned assessments and the cognitive appropriateness of the standards. The debate offered a refreshing take on what is often a politically charged topic. Many other educational bloggers have also offered analysis of this debate, including Diane Ravitch and The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Common Core: Beware Decomposing Numbers and Rinky-Dink Assessments</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. sponsored a debate on September 9, 2014, on the Common Core State Standards. Four participants argued whether American schools should embrace the standards. They included Carmel Martin, a former assistant Secretary of Education and current executive vice president at the Center for American Progress, Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B.

<div><strong>In a Debate About the American Future, America Wins</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Immigration and innovation will enable America to maintain its position as a superpower, experts say, despite policy mistakes made along the way.</p>
<p>Are America's best days behind it? Or should the world continue to bet on its future as a global superpower?</p>
<p>That was the subject of a spirited, four-person debate this week in New York City at the Kaufman Music Center, the 100th in a series called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Over the past decade, the debate event, sponsored by the public policy and education organization Rosenkranz Foundation, has featured a variety of experts weighing in on pressing topics of the day, such as the U.S.'s Middle East policy, genetically modified food, and the ethics of fracking, among other things.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>

<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p>Does widespread gun ownership prevent crimes by empowering law-abiding citizens? Or does normalized gun presence make violent crime more likely, and encourage untrained civilians to take the law into their own hands?  Do guns reduce crime?</p>

<div><strong>Common Core Revisited</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On September 9, I attended the NPR-syndicated Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "Should Schools Embrace the Common Core?" Although it has been reported that close to 80 percent of Americans now oppose the Common Core Standards, the initial poll of the live audience showed that 50 percent of the audience was for, 13 percent against, and 37 percent undecided. So one obvious question is: How much of the audience was made up of people who had some skin in the Common Core game?</p></div>
<div><strong>Leveled Reading: The Making of a Literacy Myth</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>New York public school principal Carol Burris, an outspoken standards critic, and defender of leveled reading, recently published an anti-Common Core missive on the Washington Post's Answer Sheet blog that was fairly typical of the form. Where, she wondered, is the research to support: close reading, increased Lexile levels, the use of informational texts, and other questionable practices in the primary grades?</p>
<p>The blog post, which has already been intelligently critiqued by Ann Whalen at Education Post, expanded on remarks delivered by Burris earlier this month at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate with Fordham president Michael Petrilli and former assistant secretary of education Carmel Martin. There, too, she demanded evidence of literacy improvements arising from the use of complex texts.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Core of the Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A recent debate, Embrace the Common Core? hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., featured some of the nation's top experts on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The Oxford-style 2 vs. 2 debate show included comments on topics such as whether or not the CCSS is actually right for kids and the rationale behind national standards. In particular, the debate focused on the controversial CCSS-aligned assessments and the cognitive appropriateness of the standards. The debate offered a refreshing take on what is often a politically charged topic. Many other educational bloggers have also offered analysis of this debate, including Diane Ravitch and The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. sponsored a debate on September 9, 2014, on the Common Core State Standards. Four participants argued whether American schools should embrace the standards. They included Carmel Martin, a former assistant Secretary of Education and current executive vice president at the Center for American Progress, Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, Carol Burris, principal of South Side High School in New York in Rockville Centre, New York, and Frederick Hess, director of educational policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Martin, from the left, and Petrilli, from the right, argued in support of Common Core. Burris, from the left, and Hess, from the right, were opposed.</p></div>

In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Despite years of combat and a recent surge of troops, Iraq remains politically and socially unstable, unable to establish a central government that can lead its diverse population. But there are many signs of progress—schools and universities are open, market places are teeming, and the nation has begun the long process of political reconciliation. Is America finally winning the war in Iraq?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies.

<p>It's one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debates a real debate, not one of these on the motion: China and the U.S. Are Long-Term Enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Despite years of combat and a recent surge of troops, Iraq remains politically and socially unstable, unable to establish a central government that can lead its diverse population. But there are many signs of progress—schools and universities are open, market places are teeming, and the nation has begun the long process of political reconciliation. Is America finally winning the war in Iraq?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies.

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>While U.S. spending on health care is a considerable portion of its GDP, many Americans are underinsured or excluded from health care entirely. Many argue health coverage is best left to private companies and hospitals that will operate with the efficiency and innovation that are the bedrock of a free market. Others cite medical care as a fundamental right, like education and security, and thus coverage should be regulated and fairly allocated by government. Is universal health coverage the federal government’s responsibility?</p>

<p><em>Universal Health Coverage Should be the Federal Government's Responsibility</em></p>]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> September 16, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>While U.S. spending on health care is a considerable portion of its GDP, many Americans are underinsured or excluded from health care entirely. Many argue health coverage is best left to private companies and hospitals that will operate with the efficiency and innovation that are the bedrock of a free market. Others cite medical care as a fundamental right, like education and security, and thus coverage should be regulated and fairly allocated by government. Is universal health coverage the federal government’s responsibility?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>Though organ transplantation has become a life-saving marvel of modern medicine, the donor waitlist is substantially longer than the supply, and many patients die before they can be treated. Thus, proponents claim, creating an economic incentive for organ donation will save lives. Others, however, argue that allowing the sale of harvested organs would decrease equity of access between the rich and poor and foster an illicit organ trade in developing nations.  Should we legalize the market for human organs?</p>

<p>That's a question that Nicole Vincent, associate professor of philosophy, law and neuroscience at Georgia State University, asked to open her TED talk in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>That question also opened a Monday night debate at George Washington University in which two sides argued both for and against whether "College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs."</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>Though organ transplantation has become a life-saving marvel of modern medicine, the donor waitlist is substantially longer than the supply, and many patients die before they can be treated. Thus, proponents claim, creating an economic incentive for organ donation will save lives. Others, however, argue that allowing the sale of harvested organs would decrease equity of access between the rich and poor and foster an illicit organ trade in developing nations.  Should we legalize the market for human organs?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Religion, World</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks, the nature of Islam has consumed American political conversation. While some argue that zealous leaders have drowned out moderate voices and transformed the faith into a radical ideology, others claim the vast majority of the Muslim population — more than 1 billion people — is peaceful. Is Islam dominated by radicals?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Is tough interrogation of terror suspects necessary?  Proponents argue that when traditional techniques fail, interrogators must have the necessary tools to prevent future attacks and save innocent lives – regardless of whether their practices are palatable to the American public. Others cite the potential for false information, reciprocation by our enemies, and moral responsibility as reason to end enhanced interrogations once and for all.</p>

<p><em>Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary</em></p>]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> March 11, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Is tough interrogation of terror suspects necessary?  Proponents argue that when traditional techniques fail, interrogators must have the necessary tools to prevent future attacks and save innocent lives – regardless of whether their practices are palatable to the American public. Others cite the potential for false information, reciprocation by our enemies, and moral responsibility as reason to end enhanced interrogations once and for all.</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>As its sole superpower, the United States has assumed the role of world’s policeman. Citing a moral responsibility to uphold freedom and democracy around the world, America intervenes in foreign conflicts and wields unprecedented global power. But should America invest its resources and energy in global policing? Or should the strongest nation on Earth turn its focus inward and respect the autonomy of its neighbors?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> February 12, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>As its sole superpower, the United States has assumed the role of world’s policeman. Citing a moral responsibility to uphold freedom and democracy around the world, America intervenes in foreign conflicts and wields unprecedented global power. But should America invest its resources and energy in global policing? Or should the strongest nation on Earth turn its focus inward and respect the autonomy of its neighbors?</p>

<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies.

<div class='news-content'><p>After taping this weekend's Radio Derb, with its segments about U.S. China tensions and geostrategy, I was browsing through my blog roll when I came across this at Steve Hsu's site.</p>
<p>It's one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debates a real debate, not one of these on the motion: China and the U.S. Are Long-Term Enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, Sports</p>
<p>As performance-enhancing drugs become more prevalent in competitive sports, opponents are crying foul. They argue that athletes gain an unnatural, and unfair, advantage over their competitors by using drugs, and that widespread use is likely to pressure all players into taking them just to stay in the game. But as society is increasingly invested in personal enhancers and sports become more technologically advanced, is drugging in sports all that bad?</p>
