<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Religion, World</p>
<p>In the words of Blaise Pascal, mathematician and Catholic, “Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from a religious conviction.” Does religion breed intolerance, violence, and the promotion of medieval ideas? Or should we concede that overall, it has been a source for good, giving followers purpose, while encouraging morality and ethical behavior?</p>

<div><strong>Intelligence Squared / Open to Debate atheists vs. Christians debate: Does science refute the existence of God?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time for a good debate, and Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. is giving us another one asking the question "Does science refute God?" The debate's participants for the motion were Lawrence Krauss and Michael Shermer. Krauss is a Canadian-American theoretical physicist who is a professor of physics, Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Shermer is an American science writer, historian of science, founder of The Skeptics Society, and editor-in-chief of its magazine Skeptic, which is largely devoted to investigating pseudoscientific and supernatural claims.</p>
<p>Against the motion was Ian Hutchinson, professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT, as well as Dinesh D'Souza, well-known conservative, former president of the evangelical King's College in Manhattan, NY, and political commentator, and probably best known for his film 2016: Obama's America, which argues that Obama absorbed anti-colonial hatred of America from his father.</p>
<p>The site states that "on the fundamental question evolution or creation? Americans are on the fence. According to one survey, while 61% of Americans believe we have evolved over time, 22% believe this evolution was guided by a higher power, with another 31% on the side of creationism. For some, modern science debunks many of religion's core beliefs, but for others, questions like "Why are we here?" and "How did it all come about?" can only be answered through a belief in the existence of God. Can science and religion co-exist?"</p>
<p>The debate sought to change people's minds. Before the debate, 37% were for the motion, 34% were against, and 27% were undecided. After the debate, Shermer and Krauss were declared the winners, with 50% for the motion, 38% against, and 12% undecided. Online voting results showed 64% for the motion, and 36% against, with no undecided votes. John Donovan served as moderator.</p>
<p>When the debate started, the chairman of IQ2 gave a reason behind why he was interested in this particular question:</p>
<p>So, Robert, why this debate? Why does this one intrigue you, in particular? Because I know it does.</p>
<p>Robert Rosenkranz: I kind of got interested in this topic by reading a book about science. It was by the astronomer royal of England, a man called Martin Rees, and the book was called "Just Six Numbers." It was about six physical constants that were imprinted in the early universe, in the first 100 millionth of a second after the Big Bang. These constants express ideas like the strength of gravity, the strength of the bond that keeps the nucleus of atoms together, and the uniformity of that initial fireball. And if any of those six numbers were much larger or much smaller, we would really not have a universe; either stars and galaxies wouldn't have formed, or there'd be no elements as complicated as carbon and oxygen, or the Big Bang would've been succeeded by a big crunch into a black hole in which all matter would've disappeared.</p>
<p>18:51:12</p>
<p>And when you think about this, or at least for me, I thought, could this be just chance or is there some uncanny intelligence at work in this early design?</p>
<p>John Donvan: And for what we're doing here tonight, why is this not you know, this has been going on for a long time, this conversation, why is this not just the Scopes Monkey trial all over again?</p>
<p>Robert Rosenkranz: Well, because I think this conversation should be much more sophisticated than when dealing with the literal truth of something in the Old Testament. And, in addition, of course, science has moved on so much since that time. So I think this is going to be a very a much more subtle and interesting debate than that one might have been.</p>
<p>Donovan started the debate by discussing scientists who believed in God: Isaac Newton, father of calculus, Max Planck, father of quantum physics, Copernicus, Galileo, Francis Bacon, and Pascal. He made the point that today, 3 out of 5 scientists do not believe in God. Yet 2 out of 5 scientists do. What's that all about? And then the debate began. Donovan introduced Shermer, who said he used to be a born-again evangelical Christian who knocked on doors to get people to convert. And later, when he became an atheist, he went back to knock on those same doors to tell people he was wrong. Shermer and Krauss introduced their proposition for the motion by saying "Actually, evidence is just one type of reason for belief in God, and there is a loss of evidence for Christianity. But what the critics mean, I think, is they're saying there's no scientific evidence for God. And that goes to the heart of this question and the myth that science has somehow refuted God. Actually, there are some things we've learned about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God was non-existent. Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support the more modest claim that there's no evidence for God? Not at all. They concluded by saying God is not a scientific question, so the evidence for God is not scientific.</p>
<p>D'Souza and Hutchinson took a different tack in arguing against the motion saying the questions for which God is the answer are fundamentally not scientific questions.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean. Here we are as human beings. We're thrown into the world. And we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a universe? Second, what's our purpose? What are we doing here? Third, what's going to come after? We're going to die, but what next? Now I ask you, what are the scientific answers to those questions? And in fact, the answers are, from science, don't have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue. Why? Because none of those questions is amenable to being decided empirically. Science can show how we got a universe but not why. On the question of what our purpose is here, science is completely silent. Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science. Why? Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be.</p>
<p>19:25:04</p>
<p>And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical evidence can science provide on either side of that question? So because science is in no position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology. And we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years. It's an effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation. You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could be dismissed as wishful thinking, "We wish for a better world and so we make one up." Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really wouldn't explain why major religions have invented Hell. Who would wish for that? Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life.</p>
<p>19:25:59</p>
<p>And then you've heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, "Well, belief in God depends on where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be a Muslim. If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian." Michael Shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods. However, the sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief. I'm sure that people who are born in Oxford, England, are more likely to believe in Darwin's theory of evolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi. I'm sure people who are born in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in New Guinea. What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true? Nothing. The genesis of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be sustained as a matter of argument. The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about Darwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 in the 1850s, science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>19:27:06</p>
<p>And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way. When the discovery of the Big Bang came this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning. Why? Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning. In other words, this was something that the ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago without conducting a single scientific experiment. By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies. Other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, "No, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe."</p>
<p>19:28:05</p>
<p>By the way, that's almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, "First, there was nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completely consistent with what Christians believe, and say by the ancient Hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the basis of, "God told us." The astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries. [there was laughter here].</p>
<p>The transcript is here (http://intelligencesquaredus.org/images/debates/past/transcripts/120512%20science%20god.pdf), and the video below is for your viewing pleasure. Intelligence Squared debates are formatted in the Oxford style, with one side proposing and the other side opposing a framed motion. Before the debate, the audience registers via computer their pre-debate opinions on the subject, then re-submits their opinion after the debate so that changes in opinion can be tracked. Questions are also taken from the audience after a 7-minute opening statement.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is There Life After Death? Watch Scientists Debate Tonight Online</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Is there life after death? This age-old question will be debated again tonight by a group of doctors and scientists, who will offer their take on the mystery of human consciousness, the meaning of near-death experiences and the possibility of life after death.</p></div>
<div><strong>Death Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>If you're the sort of person who finds discussions about science and religion entertaining, then you're in luck because at 6:45 CST (I think that's 5:45 here?) there will be an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on the subject of Death Is Not Final. It will be streamed live on the Neurologica blog.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Death is not Final - #AfterDeath</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Now here is a really interesting (for me) debate from Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.</p></div>
<div><strong>Post Debate Reflections: The Sound of One Hand Clapping</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The current online voting for Wednesday (May 7, 2014) night's debate shows Dr. Moody and myself (Dr. Eben Alexander) victorious (currently 68:32, from 50:50 before the debate). I suspect that is related to the listener's awareness that an audience of neuroscientists would have agreed with me, against Steven Novella, that no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain a possible mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness (the Hard Problem of Consciousness see below). The brain is obviously tightly linked to consciousness the mistake is in believing, as I did before my coma (and the debate opponents Novella & Carroll still do), that the brain creates consciousness. He now knows otherwise.</p></div>
<div><strong>After the Afterlife Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The debate hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the proposition Death is not Final was a lot of fun. Of course, I am pleased with the outcome, as I think my partner, Sean Carroll, and I performed well, and in the end, we won the final audience vote.</p></div>
<div><strong>Afterlife Aftermath</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>You'll be happy to hear that the good guys won. In scare quotes, because helping the world's population understand that naturalism is the right way to view the universe is a long-term project that won't be settled with a single debate. But Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. does a fun thing where they ask people to vote before the debate starts, and then again afterward. We started out the night slightly behind in the polls, and by the time we were done, we were slightly ahead. Mostly by peeling away the undecideds, as any savvy politician strives to do. [Update: oops, not right. See below.] So that counts as a victory especially when the topic is one where many people (not all!) have fairly fixed opinions.</p></div>
<div><strong>Near Death Experiences: Does the Brain Create Consciousness?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Does consciousness exist outside the brain, pointing to a less observable world than meets the eye? Or are near-death and out-of-body experiences simply signs of oxygen deprivation, showcasing a plausible occurrence easily explained by science? Skeptics and believers met to discuss this question on Intelligence Squared, a series of live debates that have hosted over 85 controversial topics. They argued in favor of or against the ultimate question: Is death or the end of consciousness final?</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Death: Is It Really the End?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Last week, four scientific big thinkers settled into their seats on stage at NYC's Kaufmann Center to debate this provocative proposition for NPR's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.. They would be discussing this proposition from a purely scientific, not a religious point of view, wrestling with the fundamental question of whether or not consciousness is totally contingent on a functioning human brain.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Death Final? Watch a Brainy Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>What do near-death experiences (NDEs) tell us about life after death? Do they tell us anything at all? At the last Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, a neurosurgeon, a neurologist, a doctor, and a physicist debated the proposition Death is not final. The thrust of the debate was based on the experiences of Dr. Eben Alexander and his book Proof of Heaven. Arguing for the motion that death is not final, Dr. Alexander explained how he was hospitalized with a severe brain infection, went into a coma, woke up, and eventually reported that he had been to heaven. It's a fantastic tale, but science says otherwise.</p></div>
<div><strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson v. the Right: Cosmos, Christians and the Battle for American Science</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Dinesh D'Souza, for instance, has taken to using science as proof of religion he argues, rather absurdly, that the Bible's explanation of the origins of the universe predates modern science. In his speech at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , he claims: When the discovery of the big bang came this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning..."</p></div>
<div><strong>A Bible-based approach to consciousness research</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Consider, for instance, the ongoing debate over the source and nature of consciousness. Is it brain-based or does it perhaps originate somewhere else?</p>
<p>I would say the brain does not create consciousness, said Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon, and author of Proof of Heaven during a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. In fact, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain the mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness.</p></div>

But what the critics mean, I think, is they're saying there's no scientific evidence for God. And that goes to the heart of this question and the myth that science has somehow refuted God. Actually, there are some things we've learned about the universe through science that are highly suggestive of a creator, but for the sake of argument, suppose that the scientific evidence for God was non-existent. Would that mean that science refutes God, or would it even mean and support the more modest claim that there's no evidence for God? Not at all. They concluded by saying God is not a scientific question, so the evidence for God is not scientific.</p>
<p>D'Souza and Hutchinson took a different tack in arguing against the motion saying the questions for which God is the answer are fundamentally not scientific questions.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean. Here we are as human beings. We're thrown into the world. And we can't help if we're curious, if we're thoughtful to say, first of all, why is there a universe? Second, what's our purpose? What are we doing here? Third, what's going to come after? We're going to die, but what next? Now I ask you, what are the scientific answers to those questions? And in fact, the answers are, from science, don't have a clue, don't have a clue, and don't have a clue. Why? Because none of those questions is amenable to being decided empirically. Science can show how we got a universe but not why. On the question of what our purpose is here, science is completely silent. Moral issues are in a way outside the province of science. Why? Because science deals with what is, and morality is what ought to be.</p>
<p>19:25:04</p>
<p>And finally, under the question of what comes after death, what possible empirical evidence can science provide on either side of that question? So because science is in no position to refute God, what we get from the other side is pop psychology. And we've been getting pop psychology from atheists for several hundred years. It's an effort to explain why people believe instead of providing any kind of a real refutation. You remember a few decades ago Freud basically said that God and religion could be dismissed as wishful thinking, "We wish for a better world and so we make one up." Well, that would kind of explain Heaven which satisfies wishful thinking, but it really wouldn't explain why major religions have invented Hell. Who would wish for that? Hell is a lot worse than diabetes or the suffering we have in this life.</p>
<p>19:25:59</p>
<p>And then you've heard here people like Richard Dawkins say, "Well, belief in God depends on where you're born. If you're born in Afghanistan you're going to be a Muslim. If you're born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you're likely to be a Christian." Michael Shermer alluded to that a little bit when he talked about multiple gods. However, the sociology of the origin of belief says nothing about the truth of a belief. I'm sure that people who are born in Oxford, England, are more likely to believe in Darwin's theory of evolution than people who are born in Oxford, Mississippi. I'm sure people who are born in New York are more likely to believe in relativity than people who are born in New Guinea. What does that say about whether evolution or relativity is true? Nothing. The genesis of a belief, how you came to it, has nothing to do with whether or not that belief can be sustained as a matter of argument. The reality is, and we keep hearing a lot about Darwin because the last good argument against God came out in 1850 in the 1850s, science has made a whole bunch of discoveries since then but they point in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>19:27:06</p>
<p>And, therefore, what you find very often from atheists is now highly complicated defensive maneuvers to account for things that atheists resisted all the way. When the discovery of the Big Bang came this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning. Why? Because, in a way, it wasn't just that matter had a beginning, but space and time also had a beginning. In other words, this was something that the ancient Hebrews had said thousands of years ago without conducting a single scientific experiment. By the way, this is not the same as other cosmologies. Other ancient cosmologies posited the universe being fashioned by a kind of carpenter god who made it out of some preexisting stuff, but the ancient Hebrews said, "No, first there was nothing, and then there was a universe."</p>
<p>19:28:05</p>
<p>By the way, that's almost identical to what Lawrence Krauss said, "First, there was nothing, no particles, no energy, no laws, and then there was the universe," completely consistent with what Christians believe, and say by the ancient Hebrews thousands of years ago without doing a single experiment but solely on the basis of, "God told us." The astounding fact is that 2,000 years later, modern science, after climbing round and round the mountain, has arrived at the top only to find a bunch of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries. [there was laughter here].</p>

Intelligence Squared debates are formatted in the Oxford style, with one side proposing and the other side opposing a framed motion. Before the debate, the audience registers via computer their pre-debate opinions on the subject, then re-submits their opinion after the debate so that changes in opinion can be tracked. Questions are also taken from the audience after a 7-minute opening statement.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is There Life After Death? Watch Scientists Debate Tonight Online</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Is there life after death? This age-old question will be debated again tonight by a group of doctors and scientists, who will offer their take on the mystery of human consciousness, the meaning of near-death experiences and the possibility of life after death.</p></div>
<div><strong>Death Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>If you're the sort of person who finds discussions about science and religion entertaining, then you're in luck because at 6:45 CST (I think that's 5:45 here?) there will be an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on the subject of Death Is Not Final. It will be streamed live on the Neurologica blog.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Death is not Final - #AfterDeath</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Now here is a really interesting (for me) debate from Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.</p></div>
<div><strong>Post Debate Reflections: The Sound of One Hand Clapping</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The current online voting for Wednesday (May 7, 2014) night's debate shows Dr. Moody and myself (Dr. Eben Alexander) victorious (currently 68:32, from 50:50 before the debate). I suspect that is related to the listener's awareness that an audience of neuroscientists would have agreed with me, against Steven Novella, that no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain a possible mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness (the Hard Problem of Consciousness see below). The brain is obviously tightly linked to consciousness the mistake is in believing, as I did before my coma (and the debate opponents Novella & Carroll still do), that the brain creates consciousness. He now knows otherwise.</p></div>
<div><strong>After the Afterlife Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The debate hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the proposition Death is not Final was a lot of fun. Of course, I am pleased with the outcome, as I think my partner, Sean Carroll, and I performed well, and in the end, we won the final audience vote.</p></div>
<div><strong>Afterlife Aftermath</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>You'll be happy to hear that the good guys won. In scare quotes, because helping the world's population understand that naturalism is the right way to view the universe is a long-term project that won't be settled with a single debate. But Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. does a fun thing where they ask people to vote before the debate starts, and then again afterward. We started out the night slightly behind in the polls, and by the time we were done, we were slightly ahead. Mostly by peeling away the undecideds, as any savvy politician strives to do. [Update: oops, not right. See below.] So that counts as a victory especially when the topic is one where many people (not all!) have fairly fixed opinions.</p></div>
<div><strong>Near Death Experiences: Does the Brain Create Consciousness?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Does consciousness exist outside the brain, pointing to a less observable world than meets the eye? Or are near-death and out-of-body experiences simply signs of oxygen deprivation, showcasing a plausible occurrence easily explained by science? Skeptics and believers met to discuss this question on Intelligence Squared, a series of live debates that have hosted over 85 controversial topics. They argued in favor of or against the ultimate question: Is death or the end of consciousness final?</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Death: Is It Really the End?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Last week, four scientific big thinkers settled into their seats on stage at NYC's Kaufmann Center to debate this provocative proposition for NPR's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.. They would be discussing this proposition from a purely scientific, not a religious point of view, wrestling with the fundamental question of whether or not consciousness is totally contingent on a functioning human brain.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Death Final? Watch a Brainy Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>What do near-death experiences (NDEs) tell us about life after death? Do they tell us anything at all? At the last Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, a neurosurgeon, a neurologist, a doctor, and a physicist debated the proposition Death is not final. The thrust of the debate was based on the experiences of Dr. Eben Alexander and his book Proof of Heaven. Arguing for the motion that death is not final, Dr. Alexander explained how he was hospitalized with a severe brain infection, went into a coma, woke up, and eventually reported that he had been to heaven. It's a fantastic tale, but science says otherwise.</p></div>
<div><strong>Neil deGrasse Tyson v. the Right: Cosmos, Christians and the Battle for American Science</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Dinesh D'Souza, for instance, has taken to using science as proof of religion he argues, rather absurdly, that the Bible's explanation of the origins of the universe predates modern science. In his speech at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , he claims: When the discovery of the big bang came this, by the way, was at a time when most scientists believed the universe was eternal, the steady state universe was the prevailing doctrine of American and Western science so it came as a shock that the universe had a beginning..."</p></div>
<div><strong>A Bible-based approach to consciousness research</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Consider, for instance, the ongoing debate over the source and nature of consciousness. Is it brain-based or does it perhaps originate somewhere else?</p>
<p>I would say the brain does not create consciousness, said Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon, and author of Proof of Heaven during a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate. In fact, no neuroscientist on earth can give the first sentence to explain the mechanism by which the physical brain creates consciousness.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>For many Americans, unemployment is at the top of that list. In the face of a double-dip recession and an unprecedented long-term unemployment rate, President Obama unveiled the American Jobs Act before Congress. His plan? Lower the unemployment rate and stimulate the economy with $447 billion in employer tax breaks, jobless reintegration, state aid, and infrastructure projects, to be paid for with taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Will this plan bring a fast, effective boost to the job market, or will higher taxes punish job creators and sink us further into debt?</p>

<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate.

<p>PRESENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CHICAGO IDEAS WEEK
The herd mentality that assumes college is the only path to reaching one’s full potential is under fire. Student loan debt has surpassed credit card debt, unemployment for those with bachelor’s degrees is at an all-time high, and entrepreneurs like the founders of Facebook and Microsoft prove that extraordinary success is possible without it. But recent studies show that college is economically beneficial even to those whose jobs don’t require it. Is it still the best way to ensure social mobility, or is America’s love affair with higher education unjustified?</p>

<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>
<p>The debate can be seen in its entirety here (https://opentodebate.org/debate/dont-blame-teachers-unions-our-failing-schools/).</p></div>
<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Education</p>
<p>PRESENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CHICAGO IDEAS WEEK
The herd mentality that assumes college is the only path to reaching one’s full potential is under fire. Student loan debt has surpassed credit card debt, unemployment for those with bachelor’s degrees is at an all-time high, and entrepreneurs like the founders of Facebook and Microsoft prove that extraordinary success is possible without it. But recent studies show that college is economically beneficial even to those whose jobs don’t require it. Is it still the best way to ensure social mobility, or is America’s love affair with higher education unjustified?</p>

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>
<p>The debate can be seen in its entirety here (https://opentodebate.org/debate/dont-blame-teachers-unions-our-failing-schools/).</p></div>
<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, U.S.</p>
<p>Commitments made to seniors decades ago failed to foresee the harsh economic realities of the present. Do entitlements saddle our children with unmanageable debt, asking them to sacrifice their future for the sake of the elderly? Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created to provide a social safety net. But if we cut these programs, are we balancing the budget on the backs of the aged and sick, leaving behind society’s most vulnerable?</p>

So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be.

<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.'

In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, U.S.</p>
<p>Commitments made to seniors decades ago failed to foresee the harsh economic realities of the present. Do entitlements saddle our children with unmanageable debt, asking them to sacrifice their future for the sake of the elderly? Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created to provide a social safety net. But if we cut these programs, are we balancing the budget on the backs of the aged and sick, leaving behind society’s most vulnerable?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

Education and employment statistics point to a clear and growing dominance in women’s status at home and in the workplace. Are men primed for a comeback or have the old rules changed for good?</p>

<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

The debate concerned higher education generally, not just the host institution. And at the event's conclusion, having heard arguments on both sides of the question, 66 percent of the crowd agreed: free speech is threatened. That represented a 17-point shift from a poll taken as the event began. The evidence is that persuasive.</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture</p>
<p>In a modern, post-industrial economy that seems better suited to women than men, many are wondering if men have been permanently left behind. Education and employment statistics point to a clear and growing dominance in women’s status at home and in the workplace. Are men primed for a comeback or have the old rules changed for good?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Days after 9/11, President Bush declared a War on Terror that would “not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.” Is America in a state of perpetual war, or has the threat of terrorism justified its position as the organizing principle behind our foreign policy? In 10 years we’ve been in 2 wars, witnessed the Arab Spring and the death of Osama bin Laden—is it finally time to end the War on Terror?</p>

<p><strong>Speakers For:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter Bergen</strong><br>Peter Bergen, one of the few Americans to have interviewed Osama bin Laden face-to-face, is one of today's foremost commentators on America's national security and the War on Terror. Author of two New York Times bestsellers, Bergen's recent release, "The Longest War: The Enduring Conflict Between America and Al-Qaeda", has been called "one of the most important accounts on the subject" by the newspaper. He is editor of the AfPak Channel, a premiere clearinghouse of news covering Afghanistan, Pakistan, and issues of transnational terrorism. Bergen is also the Director of the National Security Program at the New America Foundation and a Research Fellow at NYU's Center on Law and Security. His most recent book, a New York Times bestseller, is "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden, from 9/11 to Abbottabad." The book is being translated into seven languages and HBO is producing a theatrical release documentary based on it.</p>
<p><strong>Juliette Kayyem</strong><br>Juliette Kayyem formerly served under the Obama Administration as Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. With nearly 15 years of experience in counterterrorism and homeland security, she was Massachusetts' first Undersecretary for Homeland Security, a member of the National Commission on Terrorism, and a legal advisor to Attorney General Janet Reno.

<p><strong>Speakers Against:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Richard Falkenrath</strong><br>Richard Falkenrath, Deputy Assistant to President Bush and former Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, has held a range of leadership positions in U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The principal author of the National Strategy for Homeland Security, he served as Senior Director of Policy and Plans within the Office of Homeland Security after 9/11. From 2006 to 2010, he served as the New York City Police Department's Deputy Commissioner for Counterterrorism, where he strengthened the city's overall effort to prevent, prepare for, and respond to terrorist attacks. Falkenrath is now principal at The Chertoff Group, a global security and risk-management advisory firm; an adjunct senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations; and a contributing editor at Bloomberg News.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hayden</strong><br>With a prolific career in national security, from serving 39 years in the U.S. Air Force to directing the NSA for six years, General Michael Hayden has overseen nearly every branch of the intelligence community. Once the highest-ranking military intelligence officer in the country, Hayden later became the Director of the CIA in 2006, gaining unprecedented access to the collection of information concerning the plans, intentions, and capabilities of America's adversaries.

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Enemies? Frenemies? Debate on China-US Ties Concludes That War Isn't Imminent</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A former prime minister of Australia, a political science professor, and two senior members from United States-based think-tanks took turns at the lectern at a packed auditorium in Kaufman Music Center on Oct. 14 to debate a topic of the times: are China and the United States long-term enemies?</p></div>
<div><strong>Sino-US Ties: Prospects for Cooperation not Confrontation</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a debate held by "Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.", renowned international relations experts such as John J. Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies. The opinion poll of audiences that followed shows that 56 percent of those on site and 64 percent of those on-line said "no".</p></div>
<div><strong>Are China and the U.S.A. Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>After taping this weekend's Radio Derb, with its segments about U.S. China tensions and geostrategy, I was browsing through my blog roll when I came across this at Steve Hsu's site.</p>
<p>It's one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debates a real debate, not one of these on the motion: China and the U.S. Are Long-Term Enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Just before four law professors take the stage here to debate whether courts or colleges should decide sexual-assault cases, the ABC News correspondent John Donvan polls the audience of about 250 people.</p>
<p>Should all rape allegations involving college students be handled by the criminal-justice system? Or should campuses continue to use a separate disciplinary process, with different standards and sanctions, and give students who allege such incidents a choice of how to proceed?</p></div>

<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>Arguments Against Death Penalty Abolition Prevail in Great Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I have long been a fan of the Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate series, which I often hear on my local NPR station (and which too often leads me to stay in my car longer than I had intended). I was especially excited when I learned that the series was finally going to focus on the death penalty.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Just before four law professors take the stage here to debate whether courts or colleges should decide sexual-assault cases, the ABC News correspondent John Donvan polls the audience of about 250 people.</p>
<p>Should all rape allegations involving college students be handled by the criminal-justice system? Or should campuses continue to use a separate disciplinary process, with different standards and sanctions, and give students who allege such incidents a choice of how to proceed?</p></div>

And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Energy, Science, Tech, U.S.</p>
<p>To drag our economy out of the biggest crisis since the Great Depression, America needs another moon shot. Can the investment of billions into the clean energy sector trigger the creation of millions of jobs and innovation? Or would we simply be pumping dollars into the myth of a green economy?</p>

Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Energy, Science, Tech, U.S.</p>
<p>To drag our economy out of the biggest crisis since the Great Depression, America needs another moon shot. Can the investment of billions into the clean energy sector trigger the creation of millions of jobs and innovation? Or would we simply be pumping dollars into the myth of a green economy?</p>

<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Smart Technology Making Us Dumb? Take Our Poll.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I attended a recent Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate at the Kaufman Center in New York City on this question: Does smart technology make us dumb?</p>
<p>Two sets of panelists argued pro and con in front of a sold-out crowd. The audience was an integral part of the evening because it voted on who won the debate. After listening to both sides, how would you vote? Take our poll at the end of this story to tell us.</p></div>
<div><strong>News Formats Change, But the Content Stays the Same</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I recently attended an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate over whether 'smart technology is making us dumb.' Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fed's QE Program Has Been Great for Banks, But Maybe Not for Your Wallet</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Quantitative easing has been good for Wall Street, but has it done anything for the average American? It's debatable.</p>
<p>At an event this week in New York hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that holds Oxford-style debates on important issues, two teams of two duked it out over this question: Can central banks print prosperity?</p></div>
<div><strong>If Central Banks Print More Money, Will It Lead to Economic Prosperity?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>While most agree that the U.S. narrowly avoided a second Great Depression, how that happened isn't agreed upon. In fact, whether QE works at all is an open question, one that will be debated tonight in New York.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that seeks to foster constructive, reasonable analysis in public discourse through a series of Oxford-style debates, will host its latest debate on Wednesday, focusing on the following motion: Can central banks print prosperity? In the words of John Donvan, Intelligence Squared U.S.'s long-time debate moderator, four supremely qualified debaters will argue for and against the motion: Simon Johnson a professor and MIT and former chief economist and the IMF (for) Roger Bootle, executive chairman of economic research firm Capital Economics (for) Edward Conard, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former partner at Bain Capital (against); and Andrew Huszar, a senior fellow at Rutgers Business School (against).</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>How Old Is Too Old? A Debate on Toying with the Human Life Span</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Should we toy with the human life span?</p>
<p>As it turns out, four experts on that subject gathered in New York City on Wednesday to debate that very topic in a forum sponsored by the nonprofit Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>With more and more money being funneled into the field, more health data being crunched and chances increasing that scientists will crack the aging code, it's a good time to examine the arguments. That's what Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. will be doing in a heavyweight debate between leading life-extension scientists (including de Gray) and ethicists (including Paul Root Wolpe, a founder of neuroethics).</p></div>
<div><strong>Is 78.8 Years Long Enough to Live?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How long should we live? Is the age of death for the average American (78.8) about right or should science continue trying to expand life expectancies? On February 3, that question was debated by four leading experts for Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. moderated by ABC News correspondent John Donvan in front of a packed house at New York's Kaufman Center.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> May 03, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S.</p>
<p>America, built up by the hard work of its immigrants, now finds itself home to an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. The federal government, even under the reform-friendly tenure of President George W. Bush, has been unable to find the consensus to overhaul our country’s immigration laws. Both the Dream Act and an Arizona statute requiring police officers to detain anyone they suspect to be illegal, has brought the debate back to the forefront of national politics. Are immigrants taking American jobs, or, does immigration help our economy? Is there any difference between low-skilled and highly-skilled immigrants, and, if so, is it time to honor this distinction?</p>

<div><strong>Leveled Reading: The Making of a Literacy Myth</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>New York public school principal Carol Burris, an outspoken standards critic, and defender of leveled reading, recently published an anti-Common Core missive on the Washington Post's Answer Sheet blog that was fairly typical of the form. Where, she wondered, is the research to support: close reading, increased Lexile levels, the use of informational texts, and other questionable practices in the primary grades?</p>
<p>The blog post, which has already been intelligently critiqued by Ann Whalen at Education Post, expanded on remarks delivered by Burris earlier this month at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate with Fordham president Michael Petrilli and former assistant secretary of education Carmel Martin. There, too, she demanded evidence of literacy improvements arising from the use of complex texts.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Core of the Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A recent debate, Embrace the Common Core? hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., featured some of the nation's top experts on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The Oxford-style 2 vs. 2 debate show included comments on topics such as whether or not the CCSS is actually right for kids and the rationale behind national standards. In particular, the debate focused on the controversial CCSS-aligned assessments and the cognitive appropriateness of the standards. The debate offered a refreshing take on what is often a politically charged topic. Many other educational bloggers have also offered analysis of this debate, including Diane Ravitch and The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Common Core: Beware Decomposing Numbers and Rinky-Dink Assessments</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. sponsored a debate on September 9, 2014, on the Common Core State Standards. Four participants argued whether American schools should embrace the standards. They included Carmel Martin, a former assistant Secretary of Education and current executive vice president at the Center for American Progress, Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, Carol Burris, principal of South Side High School in New York in Rockville Centre, New York, and Frederick Hess, director of educational policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Martin, from the left, and Petrilli, from the right, argued in support of Common Core. Burris, from the left, and Hess, from the right, were opposed.</p></div>
<div><strong>VIDEO: Yes, Mass Collection of U.S. Phone Records Violates the Constitution</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A resounding win! A Philadelphia audience sided squarely with team civil liberties in a debate hosted yesterday by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.. Arguing for the motion, "Mass Collection of U.S. Phone Records Violates the Constitution," were ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo and Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center. They faced off against John Yoo, a former Justice Department attorney known for authoring the Bush-era torture memos, and Stewart Baker, former NSA general counsel.</p></div>
<div><strong>Does The Mass Collection Of Phone Records Violate The Fourth Amendment?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Some very smart people try to make the case that gobbling up phone data on all of us isn't really a constitutional case. Let's see if they convince you.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. held a debate on exactly this topic. If you've never checked out Intelligence Squared, I highly recommend it. Imagine a televised argument, except instead of sound bytes spewed by yelling heads, accomplished experts calmly and rationally hash out the issues with enough time to guarantee that nuance isn't sacrificed to make time for another commercial.</p></div>
<div><strong>In a Debate About the American Future, America Wins</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Immigration and innovation will enable America to maintain its position as a superpower, experts say, despite policy mistakes made along the way.</p>
<p>Are America's best days behind it? Or should the world continue to bet on its future as a global superpower?</p>
<p>That was the subject of a spirited, four-person debate this week in New York City at the Kaufman Music Center, the 100th in a series called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Over the past decade, the debate event, sponsored by the public policy and education organization Rosenkranz Foundation, has featured a variety of experts weighing in on pressing topics of the day, such as the U.S.'s Middle East policy, genetically modified food, and the ethics of fracking, among other things.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is the American Dream Attainable?</strong> <small>2023-03-23 02:26:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The American dream! Popularized by historian James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America, the term described that dream of a land in which life should be better richer, and fuller for everyone. After World War II, the American dream evolved into homeownership, a happy family, and summer vacations. Some people even aspired to get a degree. The G.I. Bill helped make the dream possible. That generation, known as the baby boomers, expected their children to do even better.</p>
<p>Why the American dream fades
In recent decades, the concept of the American dream has been deteriorating. Whereas upward mobility once seemed attainable for almost everyone, today's economy has left people struggling to afford basic necessities, let alone to save for their future. "Only half of today's 30-year-olds earn more than their parents when they were at the same age" according to Visual Capitalist (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/). No longer does having a good job with benefits equate to owning a home and having a family with two kids, a car, and a dog.</p>
<p>What has caused this shift? For starters: stagnating wage growth, uneven income distribution, increase in the cost of living, and erosion of benefits. Younger generations are forced to rethink the American dream and to accept that a 9-to-5 job is not enough. Americans should focus on building passive income that will complement and eventually replace their current wages. Let's take a look at the factors preventing upward mobility.</p>
<p>Stunted growth
According to a Venture Capitalist article (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/), the average hourly rate was $22.65 in 2018 versus $20.27 in 1964, after inflation adjustments. That represents a mere 11.7% increase over a span of 54 years, which represents a 0.2% annual increase above inflation.</p>
<p>A 2014 Economic Policy Institute analysis (https://www.epi.org/multimedia/income-inequality-american-dream-debate/) found that fewer people in the lower and middle classes were actually climbing the economic ladder today. In turn, they made less than their parents. As Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S (https://opentodebate.org/debates/income-inequality-impairs-american-dream-upward-mobility)reported, In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. What led to this phenomenon? Unequal income distribution, where those at the top receive much more than those on the bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of income stagnation and unequal income distribution are technology, automation, offshore resources, and independent contracting. More and more corporations are pushing governments and workers into a gig economy by allowing them to hire contractors and avoid the protection afforded to employees. The recent adoption of California Proposition 22 (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22) opens the gate to other companies using independent contractors rather than hiring employees.</p>
<p>Wage stagnation would not be a critical issue if prices had risen at the same rate as inflation, but that hasn't been the case. Health premiums rose 3% above inflation every year over 10 years, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation survey (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.1001?utm_campaign=HASU%3A+10-05-18+%28Copy%29&utm_medium=email&vgo_ee=TQLYTaMUxLuVgns98nuK7Q%3D%3D&utm_content=Health+Affairs++October+Issue%3A+Social+Determinants%2C+Drug+++Device+Prices+++More%3B+2018+Costs+For+Employer-Sponsored+Family+Health+Coverage%3B+Aftermath+Of+A+School+Shooting&utm_source=Newsletter&). That is not taking into account the independent contractors who would have to pay out of pocket often at a much higher premium than when working as an employee.</p>
<p>The average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a four-year institution (http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) rose from $16,590 in 1995 (in 2017 dollars) to $27,357 in 2017 a 2.3% annual increase above inflation. Median house prices have gone from $200,000 to $300,000 over the same period. That's a 1.8% increase on top of inflation. We are seeing similar trends in prices for child-car, gas, and cars all have drastically increased since 1990, while wages have practically stayed the same.</p>
<p>Creating a new dream
Not all hope is lost, however. Whereas previous generations could be complacent about their future, today's millennials and younger generations must take a more proactive approach to secure their dreams. As mentioned above, this requires a shift in mindset. Instead of focusing just on maintaining a 9-to-5 job and saving up for retirement, it would be wise to build passive income. Passive income can help you not just maintain your wealth but also continue to grow it and save toward your future.</p>
<p>There are many ways to earn passive income. My personal expertise is in turnkey rentals (http://marteleric.com/). Owning a turnkey single-family rental is a great, fast way to earn passive income while working or during retirement. Investing in a turnkey property means you buy a rental home or apartment that has already been fixed up and rented through a property management company. You buy it, managers run it, and you collect the profits.</p>
<p>The American dream is still alive. It just requires a shift in mindset and a more proactive approach. Whereas previous generations could be more complacent about their future, today you must take action or your standard of living could easily slide toward poverty. Acquiring passive income is the surest way to secure your future success.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S.</p>
<p>America, built up by the hard work of its immigrants, now finds itself home to an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. The federal government, even under the reform-friendly tenure of President George W. Bush, has been unable to find the consensus to overhaul our country’s immigration laws. Both the Dream Act and an Arizona statute requiring police officers to detain anyone they suspect to be illegal, has brought the debate back to the forefront of national politics. Are immigrants taking American jobs, or, does immigration help our economy? Is there any difference between low-skilled and highly-skilled immigrants, and, if so, is it time to honor this distinction?</p>

<div><strong>Leveled Reading: The Making of a Literacy Myth</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>New York public school principal Carol Burris, an outspoken standards critic, and defender of leveled reading, recently published an anti-Common Core missive on the Washington Post's Answer Sheet blog that was fairly typical of the form. Where, she wondered, is the research to support: close reading, increased Lexile levels, the use of informational texts, and other questionable practices in the primary grades?</p>
<p>The blog post, which has already been intelligently critiqued by Ann Whalen at Education Post, expanded on remarks delivered by Burris earlier this month at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate with Fordham president Michael Petrilli and former assistant secretary of education Carmel Martin. There, too, she demanded evidence of literacy improvements arising from the use of complex texts.</p></div>

In particular, the debate focused on the controversial CCSS-aligned assessments and the cognitive appropriateness of the standards. The debate offered a refreshing take on what is often a politically charged topic. Many other educational bloggers have also offered analysis of this debate, including Diane Ravitch and The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>Just two decades ago there seemed to be no limits to American power. 9/11, the financial crisis, and the rise of China are all reminders of what a different world we live in today. What should America’s role be in the new world order? Are we guilty of overreach, or have we not been ambitious enough?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, World</p>
<p>For all appearances, China has emerged unscathed from the global economic crisis, in stark contrast to its biggest debtor, America. China’s admirers point to its ability to mobilize state resources, quick decision-making and business-friendly environment as reasons for its economic ascendency. But can its brand of state-directed capitalism overcome rampant corruption and the threat of growing inequality, or will the American model of innovation and free markets prevail?</p>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>COUNTDOWN TO WAR China ‘learning from Putin’s Ukraine disaster’ as regime prepares for all-out Taiwan blitz to ‘cut island off from US’</strong> <small>2023-02-02 16:31:20</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA is preparing for an all-out blitz of Taiwan, a former US Department of Defence official has warned.</p>
<p>Michael Beckley said Xi Jinping (https://www.the-sun.com/who/xi-jinping/) will have learned from Putin's (https://www.the-sun.com/who/vladimir-putin/) disastrous mistakes in Ukraine (https://www.the-sun.com/where/ukraine/) and will aim to "hit Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/where/taiwan/) hard from the start" and "sever them from the outside world".</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said China is "learning lessons" from Putin's invasion and warned: "What is happening in Europe today could happen in East Asia tomorrow."</p>
<p>China regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and has vowed to reunite it with the mainland (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two nations have hit boiling point (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6506796/china-us-worst-war-in-modern-history/) in recent months, with Beijing continuing to flex its military muscles (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5573864/chinas-live-fire-drills-taiwan-drones/) by launching jets into Taiwan's airspace (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5943706/taiwan-fighter-jets-china-invasion/) and firing missiles in haunting drills (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5958186/china-military-drills-taiwan/).</p>
<p>In November last year, the Chinese dictator ordered his troops to prepare for war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - and some are predicting Beijing is "all but guaranteed" to attack Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/).</p>
<p>In a chilling warning, Michael, who advises US intelligence agencies, said China's aggressive show of force is "not just for fun and games".</p>
<p>Speaking on the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast, the Associate Professor of Political Science at Tufts University said: "It's easy to say there won't be a war when we're sitting in New York. "If we were in Taipei, I would be a lot more nervous. "Peaceful unification options are disappearing very quickly for Beijing. Most Chinese scholars say Chinese leaders have been determined to snuff out Taiwan one way or another." We do have to be concerned that what China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games. "This is actual preparation for a conflict... I don't think it's super likely, but I worry we're too dismissive. These are nationalists who see it as making China whole again. "Xi Jinping has said the Taiwan issue cannot be passed down generation to generation. "A failed Chinese invasion of Taiwan will still kill a lot of people. "Can they win overall? Probably not. But can they deal the US a devastating blow from the outset? Yes."</p>
<p>Michael said it's possible Xi "might have commanders telling him it will be easy" to invade Taiwan. The defence expert said the Chinese army will have learned lessons from Putin's shambolic war in Ukraine. And like Putin, Michael said he "would expect Xi Jinping to rattle the nuclear sabre". "You just have to worry if pull comes to shove, Xi Jinping might just pull the trigger," he said. "With a dictator, you never know... there are factors that could bring this to a head very quickly. "It might not be a full-scale invasion - it might be economic meddling, political coercion."</p>
<p>"What China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games"</p>
<p>– Michael BeckleyFormer US Department Of Defence Official</p>
<p>Taiwan is feared to be a major flashpoint between the Washington and Beijing (https://www.the-sun.com/news/3949232/us-secretly-training-taiwan-spy-missions-china/)- with a potential invasion forcing the US to either abandon the island or face full scale war with China (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5319135/china-invade-taiwan-new-aircraft-carrier/).</p>
<p>On Sunday, Republican Mike McCaul said the odds of conflict with China over Taiwan are "very high". He said if China failed to take control of Taiwan bloodlessly then "they are going to look at a military invasion in my judgement". It came after General Mike Minihan, head of the US Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo: "My gut tells me we will fight in 2025."</p>
<p>Michael said the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond to China's vast military expansion. "They are coming off a decade of really ramping up their military capabilities - and the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond," he said. "As someone who works closely with the US government, I would like to have seen faster responses from Taiwan and Japan."</p>
<p>President and founder of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, said a war with Taiwan is "not very likely to happen in the next few years". But the author didn't rule out the scenario.</p>
<p>"China is going to be checked militarily by many countries in the region, and the US," Ian said. "The Chinese is aware of that, and they don't want to get in a direct fight militarily. "The Chinese aren't being stupid about trying to engage in a military confrontation with the US and their allies."</p>
<p>"Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that"</p>
<p>– Ian BremmerEurasia Group</p>
<p>He added: "Their ability to get Taiwanese business people to change their orientation politically or else they will be cut down is a lever the Chinese have. "Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that. "I don't see the Chinese government itching for a global fight - with the exception of the reunification of Taiwan." While Beijing may be preparing for a lightning war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/) to storm across the Taiwan Strait and capture the island, experts have said the war could be anything but quick. With tough beaches, rocky terrain, well-drilled defenders, and unforgiving seas, China could face the same brutal grinding warfare that Russia is facing in Ukraine. Taking Taiwan could even require Beijing to muster a force of two million troops (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5947970/china-two-million-soldiers-taiwan-russia/), it's been claimed.</p>
<p>Last year, new photos revealed for the first time (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6583901/heavy-military-operations-south-china-sea/) just how far China's militarisation has escalated in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Chilling images showed the massive sprawl of Chinese military operations on the man-made islands - which are armed to the teeth with deadly hardware including missile aircraft, flight hangars, and spy planes. The largest of the islands in the archipelago, Taiping Island, is currently controlled by Taiwan - which is at the centre of invasion plans being drawn up by Beijing.</p>
<p>The full debate between Michael Beckley and Ian Bremmer will be released on theIntelligence Squared US (https://opentodebate.org/) podcast on February 17.</p></div>
<div><strong>Up for debate: Would doing less in Ukraine help US prepare for China challenge?</strong> <small>2023-02-23 17:18:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA HAWKS SEEK SHIFT AWAY FROM UKRAINE: Just as Ukraine is facing a critical inflection point in what the Pentagon sees as a small window to break through Russian lines and reclaim the momentum in the yearlong war, there are Republicans in Congress who argue now is the time for the U.S. to scale back its support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Among those advocating a turn away from Ukraine is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is scheduled to deliver an address today at the Heritage Foundation, in which he will advocate a defense policy that prioritizes China as America’s biggest threat and “challenges the consensus on Ukraine.” The speech will focus on “key decisions America must make to deter China – including doing less in Ukraine,” according to a press release from his office.</p>
<p>“I want the Europeans on the continent there to do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Hawley told (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQNa2lHyAb0&t=78s) St. Louis television station KSDK last week. “Obviously I want to see Russia defeated …There's no doubt about any of that.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what are America's interests in the midst of this? Is our interest in nation-building in Ukraine? And by that I mean writing checks directly to the Ukrainian government,” Hawley said. “That's what we're doing and have been doing for months. What we should be doing is saying to the Europeans, Germany at the front of the list, you need to take the first priority, the lead in defending Ukraine and standing up to Russia. We will prioritize China.”</p>
<p>NATO DISCUSSES MAJOR INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING ACROSS ALLIANCE (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/defense-national-security/nato-major-increase-defense-spending)</p>
<p>THE ‘UKRAINE FATIGUE’ RESOLUTION: Hawley is in the minority in his party, but he’s not alone. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a resolution that would express to the House that it’s time to cut off U.S. assistance to Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,” the symbolic bill has no chance of enactment, but it did attract 10 hard-right cosponsors: Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Mary Miller (R-IL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).</p>
<p>The complaints about the high cost of U.S. aid come as a survey (https://apnorc.org/projects/acontinuing-support-for-u-s-involvement-a-year-into-the-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-a/) conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that while Americans still think the U.S. should play “at least some role in the war,” support for specific interventions like supplying weapons is “waning.”</p>
<p>MCCAUL: ‘THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE’: The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says many who are wavering on funding for Ukraine are concerned about how the money is being spent.</p>
<p>“You've got people in the fringe elements on both sides that are just dug in. You have a lot of people in the middle on my side of the aisle who are just being a little bit quiet to see how the winds blow because their big question is, ‘I just want to know where the money's gone,’” Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX) said in an interview with the Washington Examiner to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If I can explain that to them, and explain the accountability and the audits taking place … and then bring the Trump national security team in to say that this is the right foreign policy. I think those combined would go a long ways,” McCaul said. “What I want to do is basically be able to tell the story of where the money has gone. A third of it's gone into replenishing our stockpile and modernizing our weapon systems, a third is going to our defense contractors to make new weapons, which we really need, and then a third's going into Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“I mean, with less than 3% of our Department of Defense budget, they've annihilated the Russian military, they've humiliated them,” McCaul added. “Without one American soldier, which is key.”</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, World</p>
<p>For all appearances, China has emerged unscathed from the global economic crisis, in stark contrast to its biggest debtor, America. China’s admirers point to its ability to mobilize state resources, quick decision-making and business-friendly environment as reasons for its economic ascendency. But can its brand of state-directed capitalism overcome rampant corruption and the threat of growing inequality, or will the American model of innovation and free markets prevail?</p>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>COUNTDOWN TO WAR China ‘learning from Putin’s Ukraine disaster’ as regime prepares for all-out Taiwan blitz to ‘cut island off from US’</strong> <small>2023-02-02 16:31:20</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA is preparing for an all-out blitz of Taiwan, a former US Department of Defence official has warned.</p>
<p>Michael Beckley said Xi Jinping (https://www.the-sun.com/who/xi-jinping/) will have learned from Putin's (https://www.the-sun.com/who/vladimir-putin/) disastrous mistakes in Ukraine (https://www.the-sun.com/where/ukraine/) and will aim to "hit Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/where/taiwan/) hard from the start" and "sever them from the outside world".</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said China is "learning lessons" from Putin's invasion and warned: "What is happening in Europe today could happen in East Asia tomorrow."</p>
<p>China regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and has vowed to reunite it with the mainland (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two nations have hit boiling point (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6506796/china-us-worst-war-in-modern-history/) in recent months, with Beijing continuing to flex its military muscles (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5573864/chinas-live-fire-drills-taiwan-drones/) by launching jets into Taiwan's airspace (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5943706/taiwan-fighter-jets-china-invasion/) and firing missiles in haunting drills (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5958186/china-military-drills-taiwan/).</p>
<p>In November last year, the Chinese dictator ordered his troops to prepare for war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - and some are predicting Beijing is "all but guaranteed" to attack Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/).</p>
<p>In a chilling warning, Michael, who advises US intelligence agencies, said China's aggressive show of force is "not just for fun and games".</p>
<p>Speaking on the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast, the Associate Professor of Political Science at Tufts University said: "It's easy to say there won't be a war when we're sitting in New York. "If we were in Taipei, I would be a lot more nervous. "Peaceful unification options are disappearing very quickly for Beijing. Most Chinese scholars say Chinese leaders have been determined to snuff out Taiwan one way or another." We do have to be concerned that what China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games. "This is actual preparation for a conflict... I don't think it's super likely, but I worry we're too dismissive. These are nationalists who see it as making China whole again. "Xi Jinping has said the Taiwan issue cannot be passed down generation to generation. "A failed Chinese invasion of Taiwan will still kill a lot of people. "Can they win overall? Probably not. But can they deal the US a devastating blow from the outset? Yes."</p>
<p>Michael said it's possible Xi "might have commanders telling him it will be easy" to invade Taiwan. The defence expert said the Chinese army will have learned lessons from Putin's shambolic war in Ukraine. And like Putin, Michael said he "would expect Xi Jinping to rattle the nuclear sabre". "You just have to worry if pull comes to shove, Xi Jinping might just pull the trigger," he said. "With a dictator, you never know... there are factors that could bring this to a head very quickly. "It might not be a full-scale invasion - it might be economic meddling, political coercion."</p>
<p>"What China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games"</p>
<p>– Michael BeckleyFormer US Department Of Defence Official</p>
<p>Taiwan is feared to be a major flashpoint between the Washington and Beijing (https://www.the-sun.com/news/3949232/us-secretly-training-taiwan-spy-missions-china/)- with a potential invasion forcing the US to either abandon the island or face full scale war with China (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5319135/china-invade-taiwan-new-aircraft-carrier/).</p>
<p>On Sunday, Republican Mike McCaul said the odds of conflict with China over Taiwan are "very high". He said if China failed to take control of Taiwan bloodlessly then "they are going to look at a military invasion in my judgement". It came after General Mike Minihan, head of the US Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo: "My gut tells me we will fight in 2025."</p>
<p>Michael said the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond to China's vast military expansion. "They are coming off a decade of really ramping up their military capabilities - and the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond," he said. "As someone who works closely with the US government, I would like to have seen faster responses from Taiwan and Japan."</p>
<p>President and founder of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, said a war with Taiwan is "not very likely to happen in the next few years". But the author didn't rule out the scenario.</p>
<p>"China is going to be checked militarily by many countries in the region, and the US," Ian said. "The Chinese is aware of that, and they don't want to get in a direct fight militarily. "The Chinese aren't being stupid about trying to engage in a military confrontation with the US and their allies."</p>
<p>"Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that"</p>
<p>– Ian BremmerEurasia Group</p>
<p>He added: "Their ability to get Taiwanese business people to change their orientation politically or else they will be cut down is a lever the Chinese have. "Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that. "I don't see the Chinese government itching for a global fight - with the exception of the reunification of Taiwan." While Beijing may be preparing for a lightning war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/) to storm across the Taiwan Strait and capture the island, experts have said the war could be anything but quick. With tough beaches, rocky terrain, well-drilled defenders, and unforgiving seas, China could face the same brutal grinding warfare that Russia is facing in Ukraine. Taking Taiwan could even require Beijing to muster a force of two million troops (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5947970/china-two-million-soldiers-taiwan-russia/), it's been claimed.</p>
<p>Last year, new photos revealed for the first time (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6583901/heavy-military-operations-south-china-sea/) just how far China's militarisation has escalated in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Chilling images showed the massive sprawl of Chinese military operations on the man-made islands - which are armed to the teeth with deadly hardware including missile aircraft, flight hangars, and spy planes. The largest of the islands in the archipelago, Taiping Island, is currently controlled by Taiwan - which is at the centre of invasion plans being drawn up by Beijing.</p>
<p>The full debate between Michael Beckley and Ian Bremmer will be released on theIntelligence Squared US (https://opentodebate.org/) podcast on February 17.</p></div>
<div><strong>Up for debate: Would doing less in Ukraine help US prepare for China challenge?</strong> <small>2023-02-23 17:18:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA HAWKS SEEK SHIFT AWAY FROM UKRAINE: Just as Ukraine is facing a critical inflection point in what the Pentagon sees as a small window to break through Russian lines and reclaim the momentum in the yearlong war, there are Republicans in Congress who argue now is the time for the U.S. to scale back its support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Among those advocating a turn away from Ukraine is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is scheduled to deliver an address today at the Heritage Foundation, in which he will advocate a defense policy that prioritizes China as America’s biggest threat and “challenges the consensus on Ukraine.” The speech will focus on “key decisions America must make to deter China – including doing less in Ukraine,” according to a press release from his office.</p>
<p>“I want the Europeans on the continent there to do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Hawley told (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQNa2lHyAb0&t=78s) St. Louis television station KSDK last week. “Obviously I want to see Russia defeated …There's no doubt about any of that.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what are America's interests in the midst of this? Is our interest in nation-building in Ukraine? And by that I mean writing checks directly to the Ukrainian government,” Hawley said. “That's what we're doing and have been doing for months. What we should be doing is saying to the Europeans, Germany at the front of the list, you need to take the first priority, the lead in defending Ukraine and standing up to Russia. We will prioritize China.”</p>
<p>NATO DISCUSSES MAJOR INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING ACROSS ALLIANCE (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/defense-national-security/nato-major-increase-defense-spending)</p>
<p>THE ‘UKRAINE FATIGUE’ RESOLUTION: Hawley is in the minority in his party, but he’s not alone. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a resolution that would express to the House that it’s time to cut off U.S. assistance to Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,” the symbolic bill has no chance of enactment, but it did attract 10 hard-right cosponsors: Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Mary Miller (R-IL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).</p>
<p>The complaints about the high cost of U.S. aid come as a survey (https://apnorc.org/projects/acontinuing-support-for-u-s-involvement-a-year-into-the-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-a/) conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that while Americans still think the U.S. should play “at least some role in the war,” support for specific interventions like supplying weapons is “waning.”</p>
<p>MCCAUL: ‘THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE’: The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says many who are wavering on funding for Ukraine are concerned about how the money is being spent.</p>
<p>“You've got people in the fringe elements on both sides that are just dug in. You have a lot of people in the middle on my side of the aisle who are just being a little bit quiet to see how the winds blow because their big question is, ‘I just want to know where the money's gone,’” Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX) said in an interview with the Washington Examiner to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If I can explain that to them, and explain the accountability and the audits taking place … and then bring the Trump national security team in to say that this is the right foreign policy. I think those combined would go a long ways,” McCaul said. “What I want to do is basically be able to tell the story of where the money has gone. A third of it's gone into replenishing our stockpile and modernizing our weapon systems, a third is going to our defense contractors to make new weapons, which we really need, and then a third's going into Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“I mean, with less than 3% of our Department of Defense budget, they've annihilated the Russian military, they've humiliated them,” McCaul added. “Without one American soldier, which is key.”</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>The Republican and Democratic parties are entrenched in calcified partisanship, where politics is played as a zero-sum game. The rise of the Tea Party, liberal backlash, and the exodus of moderate voices from Congress all point toward the public’s growing discontent. Has our two-party system failed us? Is this a call to change our two-party system of governance?</p>

<div><strong>How to Turn Obama and Romney's Faceoff Into a Real Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Wednesday night. Romney vs. Obama. Live. The 28th episode in America's long-running television series The Presidential Debates in which two men go on stage and face off without scripts or teleprompters, and with the ever-present possibility of getting trounced or humiliated. In presidential politics, a debate a real debate is a test like no other.</p>
<p>That's why none of us has ever seen one. A true debate is just too risky. From 1960 onward, the events called presidential debates have delivered not clashes of rhetorical greatness but the spectacle of two people engaged in dueling job interviews. These interviews unfold side by side in front of the same human resources representative, and the skill needed to land the position is much the same as the one eighth-graders rely on to win spelling bees: the ability to memorize the answers to the questions ahead of time, then repeat them, precisely as learned. Debates? Modern politicians don't partake in debates. Not real ones.</p>
<p>Now, I serve on real debates. I know real debates. Real debaters are friends of mine. And these campaign-season sessions are not real debates. In fact, I would argue in the affirmative for the following proposition: We must change the format of the presidential debates.</p>
<p>Because the format is the problem. While the Commission on Presidential Debates, which stages these events, was criticized this year for booking too few female and minority moderators, and perennially for excluding third-party candidates, the more entrenched issue is the structure of the debates themselves. They are designed to keep the candidates from getting into trouble or embarrassing themselves by looking mean, uninformed, or scared. That is a backward priority. A debate is a contest, a competition, a battle. The rules should be calibrated to produce the best content possible, not to protect the contestants from themselves.</p>
<p>When candidates debate each other, they should debate each other. In a real debate, the participants engage, they grapple, and they get into each other's hair (metaphorically, of course). Without that clash of ideas and personalities, there's no point in getting the two sides together on one stage. But in the presidential debates over the years, the rules have bizarrely permitted the candidates to debate without actually addressing each other. Some have spent the entire night studiously avoiding eye contact. Their escape mechanism is the moderator, designated as the one person on stage whom both candidates must address, in a weirdly triangulated conversation, as they work through the questions the moderator poses. So it becomes those questions, not the candidate's ideas or personalities, driving the discussion. It feels hollow. It feels forced. There's a simple fix for this: Make these candidates talk to each other.</p></div>
<div><strong>You Don't Seize the Center, You Create the Center</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I learned it, I thought the motion for this month's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate The GOP Must Seize the Center or Die was simply dreadful. How could the opposing case possibly be made without fighting a losing battle with the proposition itself? Of course, the GOP needs to win more votes from the center, of course, they've been successfully characterized as out-of-touch with centrists. Indeed, the pre-debate poll showed a staggering 65% in favor of the motion and only 14% opposed. This lousy motion seemed certain to succeed.</p></div>
<div><strong>Laura Ingraham: The center Isn't the answer for the GOP</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>WASHINGTON, May 1, 2013 PBS's program Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. pitted The New York Times writer David Brooks and former Congressman Mickey Edwards against radio host Laura Ingraham and Faith & Freedom Coalition founder and chairman Ralph Reed. They argued the motion, 'The GOP Must Move to the Center or Die'; Edwards and Brooks argued for the motion with Ingraham and Reed opposing.</p>
<p>Brooks put forward two central arguments for moving towards the center: The first was a scenario of a little girl from the inner city, with bad public schools, no father, and little social capital a child of Julia, perhaps who wants to exceed her given surroundings. Brooks argued that social mobility is the Republican Party's founding principle, dating back to Lincoln, and that social mobility is dependent on government for a large share of Americans.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Inseverability of the Tea Party</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I finally got around to watching this Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. over the motion The GOP must seize the center or die, with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards arguing for, Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed against it. Their arguments will be familiar to most, the former arguing the party has become too extreme, alienating growing demographic groups, the latter that standing on principle is the way to success and moderates lost just as badly as conservatives in the last election.</p>
<p>The numbers paint an interesting picture of how the Republican Party's problems are both more intractable than many realize and misperceived by most. Before the debate, 14 percent voted against the motion, afterward, 28 percent did, whereas the percentage of people voting for the motion remained at 65 percent, meaning the side opposed to the motion changed more minds and won.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> February 15, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>The Republican and Democratic parties are entrenched in calcified partisanship, where politics is played as a zero-sum game. The rise of the Tea Party, liberal backlash, and the exodus of moderate voices from Congress all point toward the public’s growing discontent. Has our two-party system failed us? Is this a call to change our two-party system of governance?</p>

<div><strong>How to Turn Obama and Romney's Faceoff Into a Real Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Wednesday night. Romney vs. Obama. Live. The 28th episode in America's long-running television series The Presidential Debates in which two men go on stage and face off without scripts or teleprompters, and with the ever-present possibility of getting trounced or humiliated. In presidential politics, a debate a real debate is a test like no other.</p>
<p>That's why none of us has ever seen one. A true debate is just too risky. From 1960 onward, the events called presidential debates have delivered not clashes of rhetorical greatness but the spectacle of two people engaged in dueling job interviews. These interviews unfold side by side in front of the same human resources representative, and the skill needed to land the position is much the same as the one eighth-graders rely on to win spelling bees: the ability to memorize the answers to the questions ahead of time, then repeat them, precisely as learned. Debates? Modern politicians don't partake in debates. Not real ones.</p>
<p>Now, I serve on real debates. I know real debates. Real debaters are friends of mine. And these campaign-season sessions are not real debates. In fact, I would argue in the affirmative for the following proposition: We must change the format of the presidential debates.</p>
<p>Because the format is the problem. While the Commission on Presidential Debates, which stages these events, was criticized this year for booking too few female and minority moderators, and perennially for excluding third-party candidates, the more entrenched issue is the structure of the debates themselves. They are designed to keep the candidates from getting into trouble or embarrassing themselves by looking mean, uninformed, or scared. That is a backward priority. A debate is a contest, a competition, a battle. The rules should be calibrated to produce the best content possible, not to protect the contestants from themselves.</p>
<p>When candidates debate each other, they should debate each other. In a real debate, the participants engage, they grapple, and they get into each other's hair (metaphorically, of course). Without that clash of ideas and personalities, there's no point in getting the two sides together on one stage. But in the presidential debates over the years, the rules have bizarrely permitted the candidates to debate without actually addressing each other. Some have spent the entire night studiously avoiding eye contact. Their escape mechanism is the moderator, designated as the one person on stage whom both candidates must address, in a weirdly triangulated conversation, as they work through the questions the moderator poses. So it becomes those questions, not the candidate's ideas or personalities, driving the discussion. It feels hollow. It feels forced. There's a simple fix for this: Make these candidates talk to each other.</p></div>
<div><strong>You Don't Seize the Center, You Create the Center</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I learned it, I thought the motion for this month's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate The GOP Must Seize the Center or Die was simply dreadful. How could the opposing case possibly be made without fighting a losing battle with the proposition itself? Of course, the GOP needs to win more votes from the center, of course, they've been successfully characterized as out-of-touch with centrists. Indeed, the pre-debate poll showed a staggering 65% in favor of the motion and only 14% opposed. This lousy motion seemed certain to succeed.</p></div>

They argued the motion, 'The GOP Must Move to the Center or Die'; Edwards and Brooks argued for the motion with Ingraham and Reed opposing.</p>
<p>Brooks put forward two central arguments for moving towards the center: The first was a scenario of a little girl from the inner city, with bad public schools, no father, and little social capital a child of Julia, perhaps who wants to exceed her given surroundings. Brooks argued that social mobility is the Republican Party's founding principle, dating back to Lincoln, and that social mobility is dependent on government for a large share of Americans.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, the biggest overhaul of our health care system in decades. According to a November poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 40 percent of the public would like Congress to expand the new health reform law or leave it as is, while 49 percent are in favor of repealing all or parts of it. Can the new law reduce the deficit and expand coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, or, as its critics warn, will it actually increase the deficit and fail to control costs that are spiraling out of control?</p>

<div><strong>Colleges Should Allow Students to Take Smart Drugs</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, I had the pleasure of debating my views on why college students should be allowed to take smart drugs. My partner, Anjan Chatterjee and I were in support of the resolution. Nicole Vincent and Eric Racine were opposed.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and FIRE, was an engaging conversation about the existing and potential role of these drugs in society, and in particular on college campuses.</p></div>
<div><strong>Why Banning Smart Drugs for College Students Is Impossible, Evil</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Should college students be allowed to take Adderall and Modafinil to improve their academic performance, or should universities treat these so-called smart drugs the same way Major League Baseball treats steroids? I attended a debate on the subject at George Washington University last night and came away convinced that banning smart drugs is not only impractical it's profoundly evil.</p></div>
<div><strong>"Smart Drugs" Are Here -Should College Students Be Allowed to Use Them?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>We use coffee to stay awake, good food and nutrition to stay healthy and alert. But if there was a drug that made you smarter, helped you learn, and made you more focused, would you take it?</p>
<p>That's a question that Nicole Vincent, associate professor of philosophy, law and neuroscience at Georgia State University, asked to open her TED talk in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>That question also opened a Monday night debate at George Washington University in which two sides argued both for and against whether "College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs."</p></div>
<div><strong>Are Smart Drugs a Smart Choice? Experts Debate at SMPA</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>If there was a pill that could make everyone smarter and more focused, how many people would take it?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> January 11, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, the biggest overhaul of our health care system in decades. According to a November poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 40 percent of the public would like Congress to expand the new health reform law or leave it as is, while 49 percent are in favor of repealing all or parts of it. Can the new law reduce the deficit and expand coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, or, as its critics warn, will it actually increase the deficit and fail to control costs that are spiraling out of control?</p>
