            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> December 05, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Religion, Science</p>
<p>On the fundamental question--evolution or creation?--Americans are on the fence. According to one survey, while 61% of Americans believe we have evolved over time, 22% believe this evolution was guided by a higher power, with another 31% on the side of creationism. For some, modern science debunks many of religion's core beliefs, but for others, questions like "Why are we here?" and "How did it all come about?" can only be answered through a belief in the existence of God. Can science and religion co-exist?</p>

<div><strong>Watch As Scientists Debate The Benefits And Drawbacks Of GMOs With A Monsanto Executive</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Tune in live at 6:45 p.m. ET on Wednesday, December 3 for a spirited debate on the risks and rewards of biotechnology and genetically-modified organisms, commonly known as GMOs.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. in New York City, will feature two experts arguing in support of GMOs and two against. Participants will "debate the risks and rewards of genetically modified food in terms of our safety, their impact on the environment, and whether they can help improve food security around the globe," according to the organization.</p></div>
<div><strong>Watch the Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate GMO Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Tune in Wednesday, December 3rd for a debate on GMOs. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. is hosting a debate between four individuals from two opposing camps, addressing the question of whether or not we should grow genetically engineered foods. Arguing the positive are Robert Fraley from Monsanto and Alison Van Eenennaam from UC Davis, and arguing the negative are Margaret Mellon, formerly of the Union of Concerned Scientists and currently a consultant for the Center for Food Safety, and Charles Benbrook, who is currently at Washington State University. The debate starts at 6:45 pm EST and runs until 8:30 EST, and will be live-streamed. Tune in, and discuss the debate here!</p></div>
<div><strong>Monsanto For the Win!</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Wednesday night, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. held an enlightening debate on genetically modified foods on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (video here). As anyone with a web browser knows, companies like Monsanto are now routinely portrayed in the media (especially social media) as the epitome of corporate evil. The idea is that GMO companies are remorselessly destroying the earth and poisoning mankind with Frankenstein foods in order to line the pockets of their one-percenter CEOs. Well, a fascinating thing happened very early in the debate that shed light on all this. Charles Benbrook, a research professor at the Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources was asked about the scientific consensus, developed over 20 years, on the health impact of genetically modified food. Here's his response...</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>If you missed the recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on GMOs, it's worth watching. Or if you prefer, read the transcript. Like Nathanael Johnson, I was initially dubious about the event, then pleasantly surprised at how it turned out.</p></div>
<div><strong>As GMOs Debated in New York, New Study Begins in London</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On December 3 at the Kaufman Music Center in Manhattan, the motion concerned whether genetically modified organisms (GMOs) should have a place in agriculture. The formal debate of that motion, part of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. series of public debates, featured thought leaders on both sides presenting arguments about the necessity, environmental impact and safety of GMOs as audience members asked questions and weighed in with a vote.</p></div>
<div><strong>In a Face-To-Face Gmo Debate, the "For" Side Wins</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, about 450 people packed into New York City's Kaufman Center to hear a genetics professor and Monsanto's chief technology officer debate against researchers who are against the use of any genetic engineering technology. Among the audience members were writers for environmental magazines, a well-known biologist who had invented major genetic techniques, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. It was a sold-out show.</p></div>
<div><strong>Finally, a GMO Debate Without Shouting</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I heard that Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. 'which stages high-profile, Oxford-style debates 'was going to take on genetically modified foods, I sighed, deleted the notification, and then forgot about it.</p>
<p>Debates on this issue don't work very well. They tend to devolve into loud repetition of tribal mantras. This doesn't beget a civil discussion that allows the audience to see both sides deconstruct or defend their talking points. It's usually about as enlightening as listening to two groups of howler monkeys defending their turf. (Howler monkeys are sometimes called the loudest animal in the world, but I'm pretty sure that we are.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I tuned in for part of this debate last night and was wonderfully surprised.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Should we toy with the human life span?</p>
<p>As it turns out, four experts on that subject gathered in New York City on Wednesday to debate that very topic in a forum sponsored by the nonprofit Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is 78.8 Years a Long Enough Life?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>With more and more money being funneled into the field, more health data being crunched and chances increasing that scientists will crack the aging code, it's a good time to examine the arguments. That's what Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. will be doing in a heavyweight debate between leading life-extension scientists (including de Gray) and ethicists (including Paul Root Wolpe, a founder of neuroethics).</p></div>
<div><strong>Is 78.8 Years Long Enough to Live?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How long should we live? Is the age of death for the average American (78.8) about right or should science continue trying to expand life expectancies?

<div><strong>Open to Debate Podcast Debates A.I. And Aliens</strong> <small>2023-02-07 21:16:27</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Is the Truth really out there?</p>
<p>Debates. You remember them. When both sides presented facts to support their chosen position. While debate has disappeared from much of our daily social interaction — replaced by conspiracy theories, demagoguery, and “Facebook” factoids — some institutions still attempt to exercise their intellect and deductive abilities via debate forums. Open to Debates is one such organization.</p>
<p>The most recent two episodes of debate podcast Open to Debate discusses futurist topics that may seem like science fiction, but could become nonfiction before long. They ask the questions “Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?” and “Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?”</p>
<p>In each debate, one expert argues yes and one argues no.</p>
<p>In this latest episode, “Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?” episode, astronomer and SETI Institute co-founder Jill Tarter argues yes. Theoretical cosmologist and Science Channel host Paul Sutter argues no.</p>
<p>In last week’s “Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?” episode, MIT economics professor Daron Acemoglu argues yes. Artificial intelligence and robotics researcher Darrell West argues no.</p>
<p>Listen to both episodes at https://smarturl.it/iq2podcast or wherever you get podcasts.</p>
<p>Remember that one crackpot theory of election fraud is that votes for Trump were beamed to a satellite orbiting the earth, and those votes were changed for Biden. Could it be possible that the beam of votes was intercepted by an alien species and switched to Biden because aliens are “groomers” and wanted to visit pedophile pizza places run exclusively by Democrats? It’s possible.</p></div>]]></description>

<p>It was 1971 when President Richard Nixon declared a "war on drugs." $2.5 trillion dollars later, drug use is half of what it was 30 years ago, and thousands of offenders are successfully diverted to treatment instead of jail. And yet, 22 million Americans—9% of the population—still uses illegal drugs, and with the highest incarceration rate in the world, we continue to fill our prisons with drug offenders. Decimated families and communities are left in the wake. Is it time to legalize drugs or is this a war that we're winning?</p>

<p>It was 1971 when President Richard Nixon declared a "war on drugs." $2.5 trillion dollars later, drug use is half of what it was 30 years ago, and thousands of offenders are successfully diverted to treatment instead of jail. And yet, 22 million Americans—9% of the population—still uses illegal drugs, and with the highest incarceration rate in the world, we continue to fill our prisons with drug offenders. Decimated families and communities are left in the wake. Is it time to legalize drugs or is this a war that we're winning?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>How do we fix the economy? The U.S. government's budget deficit is nearing a trillion dollars for the fourth straight year and unemployment remains high. With the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2012, what is the best move for continued economic recovery? President Obama says we should raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 to reduce the deficit. Others say that the richest 1% already pay more than a quarter of all federal taxes and higher taxes for job creators would slow economic growth. Are the nation's wealthiest not paying their "fair share," or should tax breaks be extended for everyone in the name of job creation?

<div><strong>Why Income Inequality Is America's Biggest (and Most Difficult) Problem</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate.

<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>How do we fix the economy? The U.S. government's budget deficit is nearing a trillion dollars for the fourth straight year and unemployment remains high. With the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2012, what is the best move for continued economic recovery? President Obama says we should raise taxes on those making more than $250,000 to reduce the deficit. Others say that the richest 1% already pay more than a quarter of all federal taxes and higher taxes for job creators would slow economic growth. Are the nation's wealthiest not paying their "fair share," or should tax breaks be extended for everyone in the name of job creation?

<div><strong>Why Income Inequality Is America's Biggest (and Most Difficult) Problem</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>Taking place at Chicago Ideas Week:
Just because we can extend life, should we? The U.S. is expected to spend $2.8 trillion on health care in 2012. Medicare alone will cost taxpayers $590 billion, with over 25% going toward patients in their last year of life. If health care is a scarce resource, limited by its availability and our ability to pay for it, should government step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving? In other words, how much is an extra month of life worth?</p>

<p>A panel of experts argued this question in a debate this week presented by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., entitled, College Students Should be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Should we toy with the human life span?</p>
<p>As it turns out, four experts on that subject gathered in New York City on Wednesday to debate that very topic in a forum sponsored by the nonprofit Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is 78.8 Years a Long Enough Life?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>With more and more money being funneled into the field, more health data being crunched and chances increasing that scientists will crack the aging code, it's a good time to examine the arguments.

<div><strong>Is 78.8 Years Long Enough to Live?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> October 10, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>Taking place at Chicago Ideas Week:
Just because we can extend life, should we? The U.S. is expected to spend $2.8 trillion on health care in 2012. Medicare alone will cost taxpayers $590 billion, with over 25% going toward patients in their last year of life. If health care is a scarce resource, limited by its availability and our ability to pay for it, should government step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving? In other words, how much is an extra month of life worth?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Religion, World</p>
<p>The popular uprisings of the Arab Spring have left a leadership void that Islamist parties have been quick to fill.  A longtime supporter of former strongmen like Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali, the U.S. now faces the uncomfortable result of Arab democracy—the rise of Islamist parties that are less amenable to the West than their autocratic predecessors.  Will the Islamists, who once embraced violence, slowly liberalize as they face the difficulties of state leadership? Or will it mean the growth of anti-Americanism and radicalization in the region?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Enemies? Frenemies? Debate on China-US Ties Concludes That War Isn't Imminent</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A former prime minister of Australia, a political science professor, and two senior members from United States-based think-tanks took turns at the lectern at a packed auditorium in Kaufman Music Center on Oct. 14 to debate a topic of the times: are China and the United States long-term enemies?</p></div>
<div><strong>Sino-US Ties: Prospects for Cooperation not Confrontation</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a debate held by "Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.", renowned international relations experts such as John J. Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies. The opinion poll of audiences that followed shows that 56 percent of those on site and 64 percent of those on-line said "no".</p></div>
<div><strong>Are China and the U.S.A. Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>

<p>It's one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debates a real debate, not one of these on the motion: China and the U.S. Are Long-Term Enemies.</p></div>

<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>

<p>The popular uprisings of the Arab Spring have left a leadership void that Islamist parties have been quick to fill.  A longtime supporter of former strongmen like Egypt’s Mubarak and Tunisia’s Ben Ali, the U.S. now faces the uncomfortable result of Arab democracy—the rise of Islamist parties that are less amenable to the West than their autocratic predecessors.  Will the Islamists, who once embraced violence, slowly liberalize as they face the difficulties of state leadership? Or will it mean the growth of anti-Americanism and radicalization in the region?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Enemies? Frenemies? Debate on China-US Ties Concludes That War Isn't Imminent</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A former prime minister of Australia, a political science professor, and two senior members from United States-based think-tanks took turns at the lectern at a packed auditorium in Kaufman Music Center on Oct. 14 to debate a topic of the times: are China and the United States long-term enemies?</p></div>
<div><strong>Sino-US Ties: Prospects for Cooperation not Confrontation</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a debate held by "Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.", renowned international relations experts such as John J. Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies. The opinion poll of audiences that followed shows that 56 percent of those on site and 64 percent of those on-line said "no".</p></div>
<div><strong>Are China and the U.S.A. Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>After taping this weekend's Radio Derb, with its segments about U.S. China tensions and geostrategy, I was browsing through my blog roll when I came across this at Steve Hsu's site.</p>
<p>It's one of the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debates a real debate, not one of these on the motion: China and the U.S. Are Long-Term Enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>Arguments Against Death Penalty Abolition Prevail in Great Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I have long been a fan of the Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate series, which I often hear on my local NPR station (and which too often leads me to stay in my car longer than I had intended). I was especially excited when I learned that the series was finally going to focus on the death penalty.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>
<div><strong>Can a Debate About Who Should Decide Campus-Rape Cases Change Minds?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Just before four law professors take the stage here to debate whether courts or colleges should decide sexual-assault cases, the ABC News correspondent John Donvan polls the audience of about 250 people.</p>
<p>Should all rape allegations involving college students be handled by the criminal-justice system? Or should campuses continue to use a separate disciplinary process, with different standards and sanctions, and give students who allege such incidents a choice of how to proceed?</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate on Campus Assault Jurisdiction</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On September 16, 2015, ALI members Stephen J. Schulhofer of New York University School of Law, Jeannie C. Suk of Harvard University Law School, and Michelle J. Anderson of City University of New York School of Law participated in a debate discussing whether universities are equipped for enforcing policies in response to sexual assault violence, or whether the criminal court system is better suited for the task.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>During the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate last week, Roger Clegg, president and general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity, argued that a diverse campus and the interracial conversations that could result from it is not a compelling enough reason to continue racial preferences, even as part of a larger calculus that considers many factors for student admission.</p></div>

<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>Arguments Against Death Penalty Abolition Prevail in Great Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I have long been a fan of the Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate series, which I often hear on my local NPR station (and which too often leads me to stay in my car longer than I had intended). I was especially excited when I learned that the series was finally going to focus on the death penalty.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Energy, Environment, Science, U.S.</p>
<p>Natural gas, touted for its environmental, economic, and national security benefits, is often thought of as the fuel that will “bridge” our transition from oil and coal to renewables. The ability to extract natural gas from shale formations through a method called hydraulic fracturing has unleashed vast, untapped sources—by some estimates, the U.S. now sits on a 100-year supply. But contamination from toxic chemicals used in the fracking process has been the source of increasing health and environmental concerns. Can natural gas be part of a clean energy solution, or is it a dangerous roadblock to a fossil-free future?</p>

<div><strong>In a Face-To-Face Gmo Debate, the "For" Side Wins</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, about 450 people packed into New York City's Kaufman Center to hear a genetics professor and Monsanto's chief technology officer debate against researchers who are against the use of any genetic engineering technology. Among the audience members were writers for environmental magazines, a well-known biologist who had invented major genetic techniques, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. It was a sold-out show.</p></div>
<div><strong>Finally, a GMO Debate Without Shouting</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I heard that Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. 'which stages high-profile, Oxford-style debates 'was going to take on genetically modified foods, I sighed, deleted the notification, and then forgot about it.</p>
<p>Debates on this issue don't work very well. They tend to devolve into loud repetition of tribal mantras. This doesn't beget a civil discussion that allows the audience to see both sides deconstruct or defend their talking points. It's usually about as enlightening as listening to two groups of howler monkeys defending their turf. (Howler monkeys are sometimes called the loudest animal in the world, but I'm pretty sure that we are.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I tuned in for part of this debate last night and was wonderfully surprised.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The debate swirling around genetically modified foods was literally on display last night in New York City, in a terrifically enlightening and well-produced event held by intelligence2 debates, where the high-profile proceedings swayed an engaged packed house that embracing GMO foods 'and the science which supports its production 'is the better choice for the United States and the world at large.</p></div>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, about 450 people packed into New York City's Kaufman Center to hear a genetics professor and Monsanto's chief technology officer debate against researchers who are against the use of any genetic engineering technology. Among the audience members were writers for environmental magazines, a well-known biologist who had invented major genetic techniques, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. It was a sold-out show.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>When I heard that Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. 'which stages high-profile, Oxford-style debates 'was going to take on genetically modified foods, I sighed, deleted the notification, and then forgot about it.</p>
<p>Debates on this issue don't work very well. They tend to devolve into loud repetition of tribal mantras. This doesn't beget a civil discussion that allows the audience to see both sides deconstruct or defend their talking points. It's usually about as enlightening as listening to two groups of howler monkeys defending their turf. (Howler monkeys are sometimes called the loudest animal in the world, but I'm pretty sure that we are.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I tuned in for part of this debate last night and was wonderfully surprised.</p></div>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, Tech</p>
<p>Does the internet poison politics? It’s been argued that the rise of “personalization,” the use of algorithms to filter what you see online, and easy access to the like-minded, have served to reinforce our pre-conceptions. Is the information bubble a myth, or is it undermining civic discourse? Is the rise of social media really broadening our world views, or narrowing them?</p>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>I recently attended an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate over whether 'smart technology is making us dumb.' Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Elon Musk killing Twitter? How bankruptcy might not be the end</strong> <small>2023-02-02 18:59:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate between an investor and a journalist looks into what is happening at the social media company</p>
<p>Last October, Elon Musk completed his move to acquire Twitter (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover) after a short legal brawl, but the joy of the move was short-lived. Having fired the top brass the same day, Musk moved on to firing more than half of Twitter’s staff, and bad news kept poring out of the San Francisco headquarters quite regularly.</p>
<p>As we enter the New Year, the situation hasn’t changed much, and Twitter continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons, like not paying rent for its office spaces and employees being forced out of buildings by landlords, The New York Times reported (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur). The question that crosses one’s mind is if Musk is out to kill Twitter once and for all.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.Intelligence Squared (http://opentodebate.org), a platform known for organizing debates, took up this question and set up a debate between Kara Swisher, the editor-at-large at New York Magazine, and Anthony Scaramucci, managing partner at Skybridge capital and former communications director at the White House.</p>
<p>Neither Swisher nor Scaramucci have a personal or professional relationship with Musk, even though they have met and interacted with the now Twitter CEO on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at various aspects of the effects Elon Musk's takeover has had on Twitter.</p>
<p>Active Users
Musk’s actions have allegedly led to a drop in usage among active users, who usually contribute a lot of content to the platform, and is forcing users to give competitors, like Mastodon, a try, Swisher said while stating that Musk's leadership was leading to Twitter's downfall.</p>
<p>Comparing it to a proverbial town square, Scaramucci argued that Twitter, since Musk’s takeover had more active users and was at the center of many important events, whether it was the FIFA World Cup or the FTX debacle.</p>
<p>Journalists could cover nuances of a story thanks to Twitter while people get updates about people they follow from the platform. Twitter Spaces turned out to be an effective medium and preferable over ClubHouse. When Musk himself joined Twitter Space, more than 100,000 people were in attendance listening and asking questions, Scaramucci said while defending that Musk wasn't killing Twitter.</p>
<p>Return of banned accounts
Swisher pointed out Musk-led Twitter has allowed 60,000 accounts previously suspended back on the platform to “improve the conversation”. Worse still, the decision to allow these users back seems to have been made single-handedly by Musk, instead of a council that was supposed to be set up.</p>
<p>Scaramucci argued that by bringing people back, Musk was giving them a platform to voice their opinions rather than shut them off. This way, he was bringing them back into the social contract. He added that when individuals speak, think and speak freely, it creates economic innovation.</p>
<p>Loss of revenue
Swisher strongly argued that Musk was indeed killing Twitter after his arrival blew off $5 billion in advertising revenues for the social media company, which was significant for income in the pre-Musk days. His plans of launching the paid subscription model of revenue generation hurt corporate clients more as users faked companies after paying $8 a month and got verified checks to their fake usernames.</p>
<p>Scaramucci added that large corporations were risk averse and did not want to advertise on Twitter due to what Musk was doing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s valuation drops
Swisher also pointed out a report that the Bank of America and Morgan Stanley who lent Musk money to finance his Twitter deal have now halved the Twitter debt on their books, which means the company’s equity has been wiped out in just two months after Musk has arrived at the helm of the affairs.</p>
<p>Scaramucci ceded that Twitter’s valuations were down but argued that the company was far from dead and could see a revival in the coming months and years. Instead with a more active user base, the company was more vital than ever.</p>
<p>Could Twitter go bankrupt?
Swisher pointed out that Musk first spoke about Twitter's potential bankruptcy (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/twitter-possible-bankruptcy-top-executives-leave). While it is likely that Musk, the world’s richest person, will not let it happen, he had many wealthy friends who could put money into the company if it came to that.</p>
<p>However, she warned that if the loan ended up on Wall Street, it could be bought by someone else, who would want Musk out before he could fix what he had broken at Twitter. She argued that although Twitter got a lot of attention from politicians and the media, it wasn’t a great business when compared to other social media outlets, and with Musk at the helm had turned into a lousy business.</p>
<p>Comparison with Tesla, SpaceX
Scaramucci’s faith in Elon Musk to revive Twitter comes from his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, staring at bankruptcy in 2008. Back then, it was Musk’s leadership that steered them away to levels that made him one of the richest people in the world (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-just-got-36-billion-richer-in-a-single-day).</p>
<p>He said that Musk may have started on the wrong foot with Twitter trying to give away verified badges for a fee but, having realized his mistake, reversed his decision. In the long run, Scaramucci expects Musk to get things right at Twitter.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, argued that too much faith was being put into Musk’s ability because of his history. Musk was good at making cars and rockets, but that does not mean he will be good at media too.</p>
<p>Twitter being a media company puts him in a very different situation, and his ideas to ‘unlock its potential’ are retreads of what many orders have suggested in the past. In fact, Musk has been unable to execute them properly and has made the site more erratic as of now.</p>
<p>Swisher also referred to Steve Jobs as a true visionary who stayed in his lane and did great things. Musk, on the other hand, does not seem to have a clue about what he is up to.</p>
<p>Musk’s vision for Twitter
Scaramucci, an investor, had access to a Powerpoint presentation for Musk’s vision for Twitter, which said that he wants to broaden the social media base and make it more inclusive. Going forward, Musk wants Twitter to become a ‘super app’ much like WeChat, which is used in China by users for social media, making payments, and personal communication.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, said that ‘super apps’ have not worked in the U.S. before, and even the likes of Apple and Amazon have tried to do it and failed so far. It might be working in China, but the U.S. was a different market, and people would trust Amazon or Apple with their payments but not Twitter.</p>
<p>Moreover, people used different apps for different purposes, like Snapchat for communication and TikTok for entertainment. Like Facebook usage has dropped, Twitter under Musk is heading the same way.</p>
<p>Twitter: Unassailable or Obsolete?
Due to its ability to connect people to events happening globally, Scaramucci said, Twitter had found a niche for itself in the past 15 years of its existence and become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Even if Musk failed in his mission to turn the company around, he would leave, and someone else could steady the ship.</p>
<p>With Musk planning to ring in many changes in how Twitter looks and behaves, users could be worried if the sudden changes would keep the platform usable. Swisher thinks that if the user experience dips and people find it hard to use Twitter, then it is likely that competitors will make something easier to use, shifting the user base away.</p>
<p>Swisher was pessimistic that the company could survive the Elon storm and compared his management style to building a rocket while it was in flight. Worse still, his decisions were taking the rocket on a downward trajectory, and Musk was single-handedly making the decisions. Swisher would not be surprised if Twitter soon became part of the graveyard of internet companies such as AOL, AIM, Yahoo, and MySpace, which were great at one time but have become obsolete over the years.</p>
<p>Impact on Musk
The time Musk spends at Twitter also affects his other ventures, such as Tesla, Swisher argued. The EV-making company had seen a steep decline in its valuation (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/musk-lose-200-billion), with Twitter serving as a larger distraction for Musk, the CEO, than when he was just a prolific user of the platform.</p>
<p>The competition in the EV market has grown, and Tesla is ceding its market share, which took years to build, very rapidly. The mass firing of staff at Twitter is also resulting in class action lawsuits and which are likely to be the biggest ones in Musk’s life.</p>
<p>Scaramucci quoting Warren Buffett that a high-quality business can endure a bad management team or terrible decisions to set the tone of his defense is a strong indicator of what’s happening at Twitter.</p>
<p>The debate was published across various podcast platforms today.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> April 17, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, Tech</p>
<p>Does the internet poison politics? It’s been argued that the rise of “personalization,” the use of algorithms to filter what you see online, and easy access to the like-minded, have served to reinforce our pre-conceptions. Is the information bubble a myth, or is it undermining civic discourse? Is the rise of social media really broadening our world views, or narrowing them?</p>

<div><strong>Campus Debate Convinces: Liberals Stifle Intellectual Diversity on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>WASHINGTON, D.C. After a 90-minute campus debate Tuesday over whether liberals stifle intellectual diversity on college campuses, nearly six in 10 members of the audience agreed they do.</p>
<p>That is according to a vote of the audience taken after the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. at George Washington University on the topic of whether liberals are stifling intellectual diversity on campus.</p>
<p>Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, along with Fox News contributor and USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers, were able to convince 59 percent of those in attendance that there is a pervasive liberal intolerance of different views on campuses, an atmosphere that hinders free speech and debate.</p></div>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is Elon Musk killing Twitter? How bankruptcy might not be the end</strong> <small>2023-02-02 18:59:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate between an investor and a journalist looks into what is happening at the social media company</p>
<p>Last October, Elon Musk completed his move to acquire Twitter (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover) after a short legal brawl, but the joy of the move was short-lived. Having fired the top brass the same day, Musk moved on to firing more than half of Twitter’s staff, and bad news kept poring out of the San Francisco headquarters quite regularly.</p>
<p>As we enter the New Year, the situation hasn’t changed much, and Twitter continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons, like not paying rent for its office spaces and employees being forced out of buildings by landlords, The New York Times reported (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur). The question that crosses one’s mind is if Musk is out to kill Twitter once and for all.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.Intelligence Squared (http://opentodebate.org), a platform known for organizing debates, took up this question and set up a debate between Kara Swisher, the editor-at-large at New York Magazine, and Anthony Scaramucci, managing partner at Skybridge capital and former communications director at the White House.</p>
<p>Neither Swisher nor Scaramucci have a personal or professional relationship with Musk, even though they have met and interacted with the now Twitter CEO on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at various aspects of the effects Elon Musk's takeover has had on Twitter.</p>
<p>Active Users
Musk’s actions have allegedly led to a drop in usage among active users, who usually contribute a lot of content to the platform, and is forcing users to give competitors, like Mastodon, a try, Swisher said while stating that Musk's leadership was leading to Twitter's downfall.</p>
<p>Comparing it to a proverbial town square, Scaramucci argued that Twitter, since Musk’s takeover had more active users and was at the center of many important events, whether it was the FIFA World Cup or the FTX debacle.</p>
<p>Journalists could cover nuances of a story thanks to Twitter while people get updates about people they follow from the platform. Twitter Spaces turned out to be an effective medium and preferable over ClubHouse. When Musk himself joined Twitter Space, more than 100,000 people were in attendance listening and asking questions, Scaramucci said while defending that Musk wasn't killing Twitter.</p>
<p>Return of banned accounts
Swisher pointed out Musk-led Twitter has allowed 60,000 accounts previously suspended back on the platform to “improve the conversation”. Worse still, the decision to allow these users back seems to have been made single-handedly by Musk, instead of a council that was supposed to be set up.</p>
<p>Scaramucci argued that by bringing people back, Musk was giving them a platform to voice their opinions rather than shut them off. This way, he was bringing them back into the social contract. He added that when individuals speak, think and speak freely, it creates economic innovation.</p>
<p>Loss of revenue
Swisher strongly argued that Musk was indeed killing Twitter after his arrival blew off $5 billion in advertising revenues for the social media company, which was significant for income in the pre-Musk days. His plans of launching the paid subscription model of revenue generation hurt corporate clients more as users faked companies after paying $8 a month and got verified checks to their fake usernames.</p>
<p>Scaramucci added that large corporations were risk averse and did not want to advertise on Twitter due to what Musk was doing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s valuation drops
Swisher also pointed out a report that the Bank of America and Morgan Stanley who lent Musk money to finance his Twitter deal have now halved the Twitter debt on their books, which means the company’s equity has been wiped out in just two months after Musk has arrived at the helm of the affairs.</p>
<p>Scaramucci ceded that Twitter’s valuations were down but argued that the company was far from dead and could see a revival in the coming months and years. Instead with a more active user base, the company was more vital than ever.</p>

<p>Comparison with Tesla, SpaceX
Scaramucci’s faith in Elon Musk to revive Twitter comes from his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, staring at bankruptcy in 2008. Back then, it was Musk’s leadership that steered them away to levels that made him one of the richest people in the world (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-just-got-36-billion-richer-in-a-single-day).</p>
<p>He said that Musk may have started on the wrong foot with Twitter trying to give away verified badges for a fee but, having realized his mistake, reversed his decision. In the long run, Scaramucci expects Musk to get things right at Twitter.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, argued that too much faith was being put into Musk’s ability because of his history. Musk was good at making cars and rockets, but that does not mean he will be good at media too.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>With 33% of adults and 17% of children obese, the U.S. is facing an obesity epidemic. A major risk factor for expensive, chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, it costs our health care system nearly $150 billion a year.
Should government intervene, or is this a matter of individual rights and personal responsibility?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>On September 23, 2011, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appeared before the U.N. General Assembly to request full membership for the State of Palestine. America’s veto power renders their bid largely symbolic, but there could be leverage gained– like indirect recognition of statehood– in the process. After 20 years of failed talks with Israel, can this plea to the international community be the only path left to a two-state solution, or have the Palestinians set the peace process back by bypassing negotiations?</p>

<p><strong>Speakers For:</strong></p>

A medical doctor trained in the former Soviet Union and Jerusalem, he also received a degree in management from Stanford University in the United States as a Sloan Fellow. Nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, Barghouthi is Secretary-General of the Palestinian National Initiative, a movement that campaigns for political reforms.</p>

Levy served as the lead Israeli drafter of the Geneva Initiative. He is a board member of the New Israel Fund and a founder of J Street.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers Against:</strong></p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> January 10, 2012</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>On September 23, 2011, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appeared before the U.N. General Assembly to request full membership for the State of Palestine. America’s veto power renders their bid largely symbolic, but there could be leverage gained– like indirect recognition of statehood– in the process. After 20 years of failed talks with Israel, can this plea to the international community be the only path left to a two-state solution, or have the Palestinians set the peace process back by bypassing negotiations?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union.
