            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> December 04, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Energy, Health</p>
<p>In the last few years, the landscape for people wanting to move away from eating meat or other animal products has changed considerably. A 2023 Gallup poll reported that 4% of Americans said they are vegetarian and 1% vegan. Plant-based meat substitute products have also become increasingly commonplace in grocery stores and restaurants.
For those choosing this lifestyle, not eating animals is a moral stance, not a dietary preference. To them, eating animals, fish, or other living creatures is indefensible when plant-based and lab-grown alternatives can provide the same nutrition without pain and slaughter or creating greenhouse gas emissions.
However, those who would rather keep eating animal products argue that humans have evolved as omnivores and that meat has played a vital role in health, culture, and culinary heritage across civilizations. They caution against vilifying meat consumption when responsibly raised livestock can support rural economies, agriculture, and even biodiversity.
With the privilege of being able to choose what we want to eat, is continuing to eat animals a personal choice—or an ethical failure? In this debate, we argue on this motion: Don’t Eat Anything With A Face.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p>The NSA collects data on billions of phone calls and internet communications per day. Are these surveillance programs legal? Do they keep us safe? If not for the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, most Americans would be unaware of the vast amounts of information their government is secretly collecting, all in the name of national security. But whether you believe leakers are heroes or traitors, an important public conversation has finally begun, and we should ask ourselves: What tradeoffs are we willing to make between security and privacy?
As Benjamin Franklin might have asked, Are we giving up essential liberty to purchase temporary safety, and thus deserving of neither?

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>

<p>The NSA collects data on billions of phone calls and internet communications per day. Are these surveillance programs legal? Do they keep us safe? If not for the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, most Americans would be unaware of the vast amounts of information their government is secretly collecting, all in the name of national security. But whether you believe leakers are heroes or traitors, an important public conversation has finally begun, and we should ask ourselves: What tradeoffs are we willing to make between security and privacy?
As Benjamin Franklin might have asked, Are we giving up essential liberty to purchase temporary safety, and thus deserving of neither?

<p>“A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” –2nd Amendment
Recent mass shooting tragedies have renewed the national debate over the 2nd Amendment. Gun ownership and homicide rates are higher in the U.S. than in any other developed nation, but gun violence has decreased over the last two decades even as gun ownership may be increasing. Over 200 years have passed since James Madison introduced the Bill of Rights, the country has changed, and so have its guns. Is the right to bear arms now at odds with the common good, or is it as necessary today as it was in 1789?</p>

In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses.

<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<p>“A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.” –2nd Amendment
Recent mass shooting tragedies have renewed the national debate over the 2nd Amendment. Gun ownership and homicide rates are higher in the U.S. than in any other developed nation, but gun violence has decreased over the last two decades even as gun ownership may be increasing. Over 200 years have passed since James Madison introduced the Bill of Rights, the country has changed, and so have its guns. Is the right to bear arms now at odds with the common good, or is it as necessary today as it was in 1789?</p>

<p>If we value a free market in goods and free movement of capital, should we embrace the free movement of labor? Reciprocal treaties would allow citizens of the U.S. and other countries to work legally across borders. Would the elimination of barriers in the labor market depress wages and flood the marketplace with workers? Or would the benefits of a flexible labor supply be a boon to our economy, all while raising the standard of living for anyone willing to work?</p>

<p>If we value a free market in goods and free movement of capital, should we embrace the free movement of labor? Reciprocal treaties would allow citizens of the U.S. and other countries to work legally across borders. Would the elimination of barriers in the labor market depress wages and flood the marketplace with workers? Or would the benefits of a flexible labor supply be a boon to our economy, all while raising the standard of living for anyone willing to work?</p>

<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate.

But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>While gridlock and division in Washington make it difficult for either party or ideology to set the policy agenda, single-party government prevails in three-quarters of the states. In 24 states Republicans control the governorship and both houses of the legislature, and in 13 states Democrats enjoy one-party control. Comparing economic growth, education, health care, quality of life and environment, and the strength of civil society, do red or blue states win out?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics</p>
<p>To prevent the collapse of the global financial system in 2008, the Treasury committed 245 billion taxpayer dollars to stabilize America’s banking institutions. Today, banks that were once “too big to fail” have only grown bigger, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs holding assets equal to over 50% of the U.S. economy. Were size and complexity at the root of the financial crisis, or do calls to break up the big banks ignore real benefits that only economies of scale can pass on to customers and investors?</p>

<div><strong>The Winning Case Against Megabanks</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>There continues to be a forceful economic debate about the cost of financial companies that are regarded by officials and by credit markets as too big to fail.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, during the severe crisis of fall of 2008, the executives running these companies felt intense pressure and that responsible officials felt these institutions required huge amounts of government support.</p>
<p>The question is: What has really changed since September 2008, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley became bank-holding companies, giving them better access to funding from the Federal Reserve? Or since October 2008, when the first injections of new capital were provided to banks that faced big potential losses? Or since November 2008, when Citigroup Inc. received a big additional dollop of support (mostly in the form of downside guarantees)?</p>
<p>There are three responses from the big banks that were ably represented this week at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate in New York. (The topic (http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/upcoming-debates/item/906-break-up-the-big-banks) was Break Up the Big Banks. I was in favor of the motion, supporting the ideas of Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (http://topics.bloomberg.com/dallas/); our side received 49 percent of the final audience vote. Opponents got 39 percent, with the rest of the public undecided.)</p></div>
<div><strong>Break Up Big Banks? Here is a Better Solution</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>"Break up the big banks!"</p>
<p>As a rallying cry, this remains a pretty powerful one for Wall Street's harshest critics. Even among some of those who understand the banking system very well ' like former FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair ' it's an idea that is difficult to dismiss. Does anyone really like the idea that 70 percent of the banking system's assets are controlled by 0.2 percent of the banks in that system? Or the fact that the balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase ' the same bank that has reportedly reached a tentative $13 billion settlement (http://latestnews.thefiscaltimes.com/2013/10/19/jpmorgan-in-tentative-13-billion-deal-with-u-s-source/) with the Justice Department over bad mortgage loans sold to investors ' is about a quarter the size of the GDP of the United States?</p>
<p>Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, and economist Simon Johnson brought up those figures about the size of big banks last Wednesday evening as the two men argued in favor of a motion to make the country's banks less of a systemic risk by breaking them into smaller pieces. The forum for this debate was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., which hosts an annual series of Oxford-style debates (roughly, one every three or four weeks) over some contentious question, such as Abolish the Minimum Wage, The U.S. Drone Program is Fatally Flawed' or 'For a Better Future, Live in a Red State.'</p>
<p>For my money, these debates are some of the best and most thought-provoking entertainment you can have. (And you don't need money to participate: They're available via live streaming online.) The debaters ' two on each side of the evening's question ' are usually smart, well-informed, civil, on point, and occasionally even acknowledge the merits of their opponent's argument. (Would that we could say the same of our elected leaders.)</p></div>
<div><strong>Seattle's New Minimum Wage Law</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Seattle experiment in wage rate regulation should provide yet another opportunity to test the effects of this type of labor market policy. In the meantime, I leave you with this informative Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the motion Abolish the Minimum Wage."</p></div>
<div><strong>What Would Happen if We Got Rid of the Minimum Wage?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Cato Institute's James Dorn and the Hoover Institution's Russell Roberts made this point at length during an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate last year in which they advocated doing away with minimum wages. Right now there are people within a few blocks of where we are sitting who cannot find work simply because their skills are not worth $7.25 an hour, Russell told the audience.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics</p>
<p>To prevent the collapse of the global financial system in 2008, the Treasury committed 245 billion taxpayer dollars to stabilize America’s banking institutions. Today, banks that were once “too big to fail” have only grown bigger, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs holding assets equal to over 50% of the U.S. economy. Were size and complexity at the root of the financial crisis, or do calls to break up the big banks ignore real benefits that only economies of scale can pass on to customers and investors?</p>

<div><strong>The Winning Case Against Megabanks</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>There continues to be a forceful economic debate about the cost of financial companies that are regarded by officials and by credit markets as too big to fail.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, during the severe crisis of fall of 2008, the executives running these companies felt intense pressure and that responsible officials felt these institutions required huge amounts of government support.</p>
<p>The question is: What has really changed since September 2008, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley became bank-holding companies, giving them better access to funding from the Federal Reserve? Or since October 2008, when the first injections of new capital were provided to banks that faced big potential losses? Or since November 2008, when Citigroup Inc. received a big additional dollop of support (mostly in the form of downside guarantees)?</p>
<p>There are three responses from the big banks that were ably represented this week at an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate in New York. (The topic (http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/upcoming-debates/item/906-break-up-the-big-banks) was Break Up the Big Banks. I was in favor of the motion, supporting the ideas of Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (http://topics.bloomberg.com/dallas/); our side received 49 percent of the final audience vote. Opponents got 39 percent, with the rest of the public undecided.)</p></div>
<div><strong>Break Up Big Banks? Here is a Better Solution</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>"Break up the big banks!"</p>
<p>As a rallying cry, this remains a pretty powerful one for Wall Street's harshest critics. Even among some of those who understand the banking system very well ' like former FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair ' it's an idea that is difficult to dismiss. Does anyone really like the idea that 70 percent of the banking system's assets are controlled by 0.2 percent of the banks in that system? Or the fact that the balance sheet of JPMorgan Chase ' the same bank that has reportedly reached a tentative $13 billion settlement (http://latestnews.thefiscaltimes.com/2013/10/19/jpmorgan-in-tentative-13-billion-deal-with-u-s-source/) with the Justice Department over bad mortgage loans sold to investors ' is about a quarter the size of the GDP of the United States?</p>
<p>Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, and economist Simon Johnson brought up those figures about the size of big banks last Wednesday evening as the two men argued in favor of a motion to make the country's banks less of a systemic risk by breaking them into smaller pieces. The forum for this debate was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., which hosts an annual series of Oxford-style debates (roughly, one every three or four weeks) over some contentious question, such as Abolish the Minimum Wage, The U.S. Drone Program is Fatally Flawed' or 'For a Better Future, Live in a Red State.'</p>
<p>For my money, these debates are some of the best and most thought-provoking entertainment you can have. (And you don't need money to participate: They're available via live streaming online.) The debaters ' two on each side of the evening's question ' are usually smart, well-informed, civil, on point, and occasionally even acknowledge the merits of their opponent's argument. (Would that we could say the same of our elected leaders.)</p></div>

<p>Remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, have been the centerpiece of America’s counterterrorism toolkit since the start of the Obama presidency, and the benefits have been clear. Their use has significantly weakened al Qaeda and the Taliban while keeping American troops out of harm’s way. But critics of drone strikes argue that the short-term gains do not outweigh the long-term consequences—among them, radicalization of a public outraged over civilian deaths. Is our drone program hurting, or helping, in the fight against terrorism?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<p>Remotely piloted aircraft, or drones, have been the centerpiece of America’s counterterrorism toolkit since the start of the Obama presidency, and the benefits have been clear. Their use has significantly weakened al Qaeda and the Taliban while keeping American troops out of harm’s way. But critics of drone strikes argue that the short-term gains do not outweigh the long-term consequences—among them, radicalization of a public outraged over civilian deaths. Is our drone program hurting, or helping, in the fight against terrorism?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins.

<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>

<p>There are certain international crises that on their face demand the immediate and urgent attention of presidents. We all know them when we see them—and so does the man in the White House. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait comes to mind—an easy call. But there are other situations where the call may be tougher to make. Bosnia got a president's attention; Rwanda did not. And what about Syria—now in the midst of a civil war and humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions. Certainly there are U.S. interests at stake, but are they vital interests? And what of President Obama's response so far: it has been deliberately limited, but should he go further, and with what sorts of options? Military intervention? Something else? Something less? One thing is certain: Syria is not one of those easy calls. It's what we're debating in Aspen, when we take on the topic: The U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria.</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>

<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>There are certain international crises that on their face demand the immediate and urgent attention of presidents. We all know them when we see them—and so does the man in the White House. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait comes to mind—an easy call. But there are other situations where the call may be tougher to make. Bosnia got a president's attention; Rwanda did not. And what about Syria—now in the midst of a civil war and humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions. Certainly there are U.S. interests at stake, but are they vital interests? And what of President Obama's response so far: it has been deliberately limited, but should he go further, and with what sorts of options? Military intervention? Something else? Something less? One thing is certain: Syria is not one of those easy calls. It's what we're debating in Aspen, when we take on the topic: The U.S. has no dog in the fight in Syria.</p>

<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>

<p><strong>Presented in Partnership with The McCain Institute for International Leadership </strong>
Political gridlock in Washington triggered across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, in March. As a result, the Pentagon was given six months to eliminate $41 billion from the current year’s budget, and unlike past cuts, this time everything is on the table. In 2011, America spent $711 billion dollars on its defense—more than the next 13 highest spending countries combined. But the burdens it shoulders, both at home and abroad, are unprecedented. Could the sequester be a rare opportunity to overhaul the armed forces, or will its impact damage military readiness and endanger national security?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p><strong>Presented in Partnership with The McCain Institute for International Leadership </strong>
Political gridlock in Washington triggered across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, in March. As a result, the Pentagon was given six months to eliminate $41 billion from the current year’s budget, and unlike past cuts, this time everything is on the table. In 2011, America spent $711 billion dollars on its defense—more than the next 13 highest spending countries combined. But the burdens it shoulders, both at home and abroad, are unprecedented. Could the sequester be a rare opportunity to overhaul the armed forces, or will its impact damage military readiness and endanger national security?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration, the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency in the U.S. federal government, is charged with protecting the public health. Under this mandate, it regulates drugs and medical devices for their safety and effectiveness. But is it a failing mandate?  It’s long been argued that the FDA’s long and costly approval processes stifle innovation and keep life-changing treatments from the market. But the question remains: when it comes to public health, is it ever okay to sacrifice safety for speed?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, I had the pleasure of debating my views on why college students should be allowed to take smart drugs. My partner, Anjan Chatterjee and I were in support of the resolution. Nicole Vincent and Eric Racine were opposed.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and FIRE, was an engaging conversation about the existing and potential role of these drugs in society, and in particular on college campuses.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Should college students be allowed to take Adderall and Modafinil to improve their academic performance, or should universities treat these so-called smart drugs the same way Major League Baseball treats steroids? I attended a debate on the subject at George Washington University last night and came away convinced that banning smart drugs is not only impractical it's profoundly evil.</p></div>

<p>That's a question that Nicole Vincent, associate professor of philosophy, law and neuroscience at Georgia State University, asked to open her TED talk in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>That question also opened a Monday night debate at George Washington University in which two sides argued both for and against whether "College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs."</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> May 08, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration, the oldest comprehensive consumer protection agency in the U.S. federal government, is charged with protecting the public health. Under this mandate, it regulates drugs and medical devices for their safety and effectiveness. But is it a failing mandate?  It’s long been argued that the FDA’s long and costly approval processes stifle innovation and keep life-changing treatments from the market. But the question remains: when it comes to public health, is it ever okay to sacrifice safety for speed?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Last night, I had the pleasure of debating my views on why college students should be allowed to take smart drugs. My partner, Anjan Chatterjee and I were in support of the resolution. Nicole Vincent and Eric Racine were opposed.</p>
<p>The debate, hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and FIRE, was an engaging conversation about the existing and potential role of these drugs in society, and in particular on college campuses.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>We use coffee to stay awake, good food and nutrition to stay healthy and alert. But if there was a drug that made you smarter, helped you learn, and made you more focused, would you take it?</p>
<p>That's a question that Nicole Vincent, associate professor of philosophy, law and neuroscience at Georgia State University, asked to open her TED talk in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>That question also opened a Monday night debate at George Washington University in which two sides argued both for and against whether "College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs."</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> April 17, 2013</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>2012 was a disappointing year for Republicans. The failure to win key swing states in the presidential election and surprising losses in the House and Senate have prompted some reflection. Was their embrace of small government, low taxes, and a strong conservative stance on social issues at odds with shifting American demographics? Or did the GOP embrace the right platform, but the wrong candidates?</p>

<div><strong>How to Turn Obama and Romney's Faceoff Into a Real Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Wednesday night. Romney vs. Obama. Live. The 28th episode in America's long-running television series The Presidential Debates in which two men go on stage and face off without scripts or teleprompters, and with the ever-present possibility of getting trounced or humiliated. In presidential politics, a debate a real debate is a test like no other.</p>
<p>That's why none of us has ever seen one. A true debate is just too risky. From 1960 onward, the events called presidential debates have delivered not clashes of rhetorical greatness but the spectacle of two people engaged in dueling job interviews. These interviews unfold side by side in front of the same human resources representative, and the skill needed to land the position is much the same as the one eighth-graders rely on to win spelling bees: the ability to memorize the answers to the questions ahead of time, then repeat them, precisely as learned. Debates? Modern politicians don't partake in debates. Not real ones.</p>
<p>Now, I serve on real debates. I know real debates. Real debaters are friends of mine. And these campaign-season sessions are not real debates. In fact, I would argue in the affirmative for the following proposition: We must change the format of the presidential debates.</p>
<p>Because the format is the problem. While the Commission on Presidential Debates, which stages these events, was criticized this year for booking too few female and minority moderators, and perennially for excluding third-party candidates, the more entrenched issue is the structure of the debates themselves. They are designed to keep the candidates from getting into trouble or embarrassing themselves by looking mean, uninformed, or scared. That is a backward priority. A debate is a contest, a competition, a battle. The rules should be calibrated to produce the best content possible, not to protect the contestants from themselves.</p>
<p>When candidates debate each other, they should debate each other. In a real debate, the participants engage, they grapple, and they get into each other's hair (metaphorically, of course). Without that clash of ideas and personalities, there's no point in getting the two sides together on one stage. But in the presidential debates over the years, the rules have bizarrely permitted the candidates to debate without actually addressing each other. Some have spent the entire night studiously avoiding eye contact. Their escape mechanism is the moderator, designated as the one person on stage whom both candidates must address, in a weirdly triangulated conversation, as they work through the questions the moderator poses. So it becomes those questions, not the candidate's ideas or personalities, driving the discussion. It feels hollow. It feels forced. There's a simple fix for this: Make these candidates talk to each other.</p></div>
<div><strong>You Don't Seize the Center, You Create the Center</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I learned it, I thought the motion for this month's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate The GOP Must Seize the Center or Die was simply dreadful. How could the opposing case possibly be made without fighting a losing battle with the proposition itself? Of course, the GOP needs to win more votes from the center, of course, they've been successfully characterized as out-of-touch with centrists. Indeed, the pre-debate poll showed a staggering 65% in favor of the motion and only 14% opposed. This lousy motion seemed certain to succeed.</p></div>
<div><strong>Laura Ingraham: The center Isn't the answer for the GOP</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>WASHINGTON, May 1, 2013 PBS's program Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. pitted The New York Times writer David Brooks and former Congressman Mickey Edwards against radio host Laura Ingraham and Faith & Freedom Coalition founder and chairman Ralph Reed. They argued the motion, 'The GOP Must Move to the Center or Die'; Edwards and Brooks argued for the motion with Ingraham and Reed opposing.</p>
<p>Brooks put forward two central arguments for moving towards the center: The first was a scenario of a little girl from the inner city, with bad public schools, no father, and little social capital a child of Julia, perhaps who wants to exceed her given surroundings. Brooks argued that social mobility is the Republican Party's founding principle, dating back to Lincoln, and that social mobility is dependent on government for a large share of Americans.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Inseverability of the Tea Party</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I finally got around to watching this Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. over the motion The GOP must seize the center or die, with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards arguing for, Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed against it. Their arguments will be familiar to most, the former arguing the party has become too extreme, alienating growing demographic groups, the latter that standing on principle is the way to success and moderates lost just as badly as conservatives in the last election.</p>
<p>The numbers paint an interesting picture of how the Republican Party's problems are both more intractable than many realize and misperceived by most. Before the debate, 14 percent voted against the motion, afterward, 28 percent did, whereas the percentage of people voting for the motion remained at 65 percent, meaning the side opposed to the motion changed more minds and won.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>2012 was a disappointing year for Republicans. The failure to win key swing states in the presidential election and surprising losses in the House and Senate have prompted some reflection. Was their embrace of small government, low taxes, and a strong conservative stance on social issues at odds with shifting American demographics? Or did the GOP embrace the right platform, but the wrong candidates?</p>

<div><strong>How to Turn Obama and Romney's Faceoff Into a Real Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Wednesday night. Romney vs. Obama. Live. The 28th episode in America's long-running television series The Presidential Debates in which two men go on stage and face off without scripts or teleprompters, and with the ever-present possibility of getting trounced or humiliated. In presidential politics, a debate a real debate is a test like no other.</p>
<p>That's why none of us has ever seen one. A true debate is just too risky. From 1960 onward, the events called presidential debates have delivered not clashes of rhetorical greatness but the spectacle of two people engaged in dueling job interviews. These interviews unfold side by side in front of the same human resources representative, and the skill needed to land the position is much the same as the one eighth-graders rely on to win spelling bees: the ability to memorize the answers to the questions ahead of time, then repeat them, precisely as learned. Debates? Modern politicians don't partake in debates. Not real ones.</p>
<p>Now, I serve on real debates. I know real debates. Real debaters are friends of mine. And these campaign-season sessions are not real debates. In fact, I would argue in the affirmative for the following proposition: We must change the format of the presidential debates.</p>
<p>Because the format is the problem. While the Commission on Presidential Debates, which stages these events, was criticized this year for booking too few female and minority moderators, and perennially for excluding third-party candidates, the more entrenched issue is the structure of the debates themselves. They are designed to keep the candidates from getting into trouble or embarrassing themselves by looking mean, uninformed, or scared. That is a backward priority. A debate is a contest, a competition, a battle. The rules should be calibrated to produce the best content possible, not to protect the contestants from themselves.</p>
<p>When candidates debate each other, they should debate each other. In a real debate, the participants engage, they grapple, and they get into each other's hair (metaphorically, of course). Without that clash of ideas and personalities, there's no point in getting the two sides together on one stage. But in the presidential debates over the years, the rules have bizarrely permitted the candidates to debate without actually addressing each other. Some have spent the entire night studiously avoiding eye contact. Their escape mechanism is the moderator, designated as the one person on stage whom both candidates must address, in a weirdly triangulated conversation, as they work through the questions the moderator poses. So it becomes those questions, not the candidate's ideas or personalities, driving the discussion. It feels hollow. It feels forced. There's a simple fix for this: Make these candidates talk to each other.</p></div>
<div><strong>You Don't Seize the Center, You Create the Center</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>When I learned it, I thought the motion for this month's Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate The GOP Must Seize the Center or Die was simply dreadful. How could the opposing case possibly be made without fighting a losing battle with the proposition itself? Of course, the GOP needs to win more votes from the center, of course, they've been successfully characterized as out-of-touch with centrists. Indeed, the pre-debate poll showed a staggering 65% in favor of the motion and only 14% opposed. This lousy motion seemed certain to succeed.</p></div>
<div><strong>Laura Ingraham: The center Isn't the answer for the GOP</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>WASHINGTON, May 1, 2013 PBS's program Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. pitted The New York Times writer David Brooks and former Congressman Mickey Edwards against radio host Laura Ingraham and Faith & Freedom Coalition founder and chairman Ralph Reed. They argued the motion, 'The GOP Must Move to the Center or Die'; Edwards and Brooks argued for the motion with Ingraham and Reed opposing.</p>
<p>Brooks put forward two central arguments for moving towards the center: The first was a scenario of a little girl from the inner city, with bad public schools, no father, and little social capital a child of Julia, perhaps who wants to exceed her given surroundings. Brooks argued that social mobility is the Republican Party's founding principle, dating back to Lincoln, and that social mobility is dependent on government for a large share of Americans.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Inseverability of the Tea Party</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I finally got around to watching this Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. over the motion The GOP must seize the center or die, with David Brooks and Mickey Edwards arguing for, Laura Ingraham and Ralph Reed against it. Their arguments will be familiar to most, the former arguing the party has become too extreme, alienating growing demographic groups, the latter that standing on principle is the way to success and moderates lost just as badly as conservatives in the last election.</p>
<p>The numbers paint an interesting picture of how the Republican Party's problems are both more intractable than many realize and misperceived by most. Before the debate, 14 percent voted against the motion, afterward, 28 percent did, whereas the percentage of people voting for the motion remained at 65 percent, meaning the side opposed to the motion changed more minds and won.</p></div>

<p>The first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage, a part of 1933’s sweeping National Industrial Recovery Act, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935. But in 1938, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law a minimum hourly wage of 25 cents—$4.07 in today’s dollars. Three-quarters of a century later, we are still debating the merits of this cornerstone of the New Deal. Do we need government to ensure a decent paycheck, or would low-wage workers and the economy be better off without its intervention?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be.

<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data.

<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>The first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage, a part of 1933’s sweeping National Industrial Recovery Act, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1935. But in 1938, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed into law a minimum hourly wage of 25 cents—$4.07 in today’s dollars. Three-quarters of a century later, we are still debating the merits of this cornerstone of the New Deal. Do we need government to ensure a decent paycheck, or would low-wage workers and the economy be better off without its intervention?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>It’s often taken for granted that America needs a strong dollar.  When the value of the U.S. dollar is strong relative to other currencies, it becomes attractive to investors and allows Americans to buy foreign goods and services cheaply.  But in times of recession, are we better off with a weak dollar that stimulates U.S. manufacturing by making our goods cheaper and more competitive?  Or will the loss of purchasing power and currency manipulation abroad, offset the potential gains?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>It’s often taken for granted that America needs a strong dollar.  When the value of the U.S. dollar is strong relative to other currencies, it becomes attractive to investors and allows Americans to buy foreign goods and services cheaply.  But in times of recession, are we better off with a weak dollar that stimulates U.S. manufacturing by making our goods cheaper and more competitive?  Or will the loss of purchasing power and currency manipulation abroad, offset the potential gains?</p>

<div><strong>Why Income Inequality Is America's Biggest (and Most Difficult) Problem</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, Science</p>
<p>Imagine a world free of genetic diseases, where parents control their offspring’s height, eye color and intelligence. The science may be closer than you think. Genes interact in ways that we don’t fully understand and there could be unintended consequences, new diseases that result from our tinkering. But even if the science could be perfected, is it morally wrong? Would it lead to eugenics and a stratified society where only the rich enjoy the benefits of genetic enhancement? Or would the real injustice be depriving our children of every scientifically possible opportunity?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, Science</p>
<p>Imagine a world free of genetic diseases, where parents control their offspring’s height, eye color and intelligence. The science may be closer than you think. Genes interact in ways that we don’t fully understand and there could be unintended consequences, new diseases that result from our tinkering. But even if the science could be perfected, is it morally wrong? Would it lead to eugenics and a stratified society where only the rich enjoy the benefits of genetic enhancement? Or would the real injustice be depriving our children of every scientifically possible opportunity?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2012, despite increased international pressure and economic sanctions, Iran doubled the number of nuclear centrifuges installed in its underground Fordow site, stopping just short of the capacity to produce nuclear fuel. President Obama has rejected Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s call to draw a “red line” that would trigger U.S. military action. But what would the costs and benefits of military action be? Can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, or could the time be near for a pre-emptive strike?</p>

<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Over the summer of 2012, despite increased international pressure and economic sanctions, Iran doubled the number of nuclear centrifuges installed in its underground Fordow site, stopping just short of the capacity to produce nuclear fuel. President Obama has rejected Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s call to draw a “red line” that would trigger U.S. military action. But what would the costs and benefits of military action be? Can Israel live with a nuclear Iran, or could the time be near for a pre-emptive strike?</p>

<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
