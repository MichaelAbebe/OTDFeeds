<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Energy, Health, Science</p>
<p>Genetically modified (GM) foods have been around for decades. Created by modifying the DNA of one organism through the introduction of genes from another, they are developed for a number of different reasons—to fight disease, enhance flavor, resist pests, improve nutrition, survive drought—and are mainly found in our food supply in processed foods using corn, soybeans, and sugar beets, and as feed for farm animals. Across the country and around the world, communities are fighting the cultivation of genetically engineered crops. Are they safe? How do they impact the environment? Can they improve food security? Is the world better off with or without GM food?</p>

<div><strong>Science communication is key to public acceptance, innovation</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:33:46</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Nov. 26 ATHENS Genetic improvement, particularly improvements related to animal production, has been one of the most transformational agricultural advancements in our history.</p>
<p>The breeding of healthier, more productive livestock has been achieved through genetic selection over the course of time, both through natural genetic selection and through increased use of artificial insemination, particularly in poultry and cattle production. These advancements have increased production levels dramatically: For example, there were approximately 26 million dairy cattle producing milk in the U.S. in 1950, but through genetic selection, this number dropped to approximately 9 million dairy cattle in 2010, all while milk production increased and production costs decreased.</p>
<p>Increases in efficiency driven by technological advancements that have been widely adopted by industry have created a more stable agricultural system worldwide.</p>
<p>What if we had not been able to make these improvements because the public was not in favor of genetic selection? said Alison Van Eenennaam, professor of cooperative extension at the University of California, Davis, the guest speaker for the 2022 D.W. Brooks Lecture held Nov. 8.</p>
<p>Using the complicated past of genetically modified organisms and the rich history of agricultural innovation as examples, Van Eenennaam made a compelling case for the increased use of thoughtful, direct science communication that seeks to explain the why behind the technological advancements that are designed to feed a growing world population.</p>
<p>Agricultural innovations are not always accepted with open arms, however. GMOs — for some, the darling of agricultural advancement, and for others, the villain have suffered in the court of public opinion, much to the dismay of agricultural scientists in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>A respected member of the agricultural and scientific community, Van Eenennaam has appeared on national television and in debate series, such as the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. in New York City, as an advocate for the use of GMOs, which have been shown to be a safe, sustainable option to increase food production.</p>
<p>Although she has done extensive work in GMO advocacy, Van Eenennaam's own research centers on a different topic entirely: genome editing. A relatively new and novel technology, genome editing seeks to adjust the DNA of organisms in order to select desirable traits that improve performance and health. Her current work seeks to use genome editing to increase the prevalence of cattle born without horns.</p>
<p>Similar to her efforts to communicate the facts about GMOs, Van Eenennaam has gone to great lengths to communicate her own research in a way that makes the purpose of genome editing understandable. Most notably, Van Eenennaam, along with one of her genome-editing success stories, Cosmo, worked with PBS Nova to showcase this advancement in agricultural technology.</p>
<p>To me, this project combined all the elements of science communication, Van Eenennaam said of the documentary. It doesn't touch on the how hardly at all it touches on the why and does it in an engaging style that is ... comprehensible by the general public."</p>
<p>Innovation enables us to produce more food with fewer resources, breed the most efficient livestock, and even cure diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In order to find success in these areas and more, we must be willing to adopt the technologies that enable a more efficient path toward that success. Innovation is the driving force behind societal advancement, Van Eenennaam said.</p>
<p>I hope that we can engage narrative storytellers or else develop that technology and skill ourselves to tell a story around genome editing, be it for plants or animals so that we're actually able to use that in future breeding programs, she said. I hope I've shown you that the opportunity cost of not adopting innovation is very real and not always very obvious. Not being able to use improved breeding techniques would have very big environmental and food security consequences.</p>
<p>The 2022 D.W. Brooks Faculty Awards for Excellence also were recognized at the lecture, which is held annually in honor of the late D.W. Brooks, a Georgian who dedicated his life to the advancement of agriculture in our state and across the world.</p>
<p>This year's honorees include Samuel Aggrey, recognized for Excellence in International Agricultural and Environmental Sciences; Kylee Jo Duberstein, recognized for Excellence in Teaching; Pam Knox, recognized for Excellence in Extension; Peggy Ozias-Akins, recognized for Excellence in Research; and Rachel Stewart, recognized for Excellence in Public Service Extension.</p>

<p>I hope that we can engage narrative storytellers or else develop that technology and skill ourselves to tell a story around genome editing, be it for plants or animals so that we're actually able to use that in future breeding programs, she said. I hope I've shown you that the opportunity cost of not adopting innovation is very real and not always very obvious. Not being able to use improved breeding techniques would have very big environmental and food security consequences.</p>
<p>The 2022 D.W. Brooks Faculty Awards for Excellence also were recognized at the lecture, which is held annually in honor of the late D.W. Brooks, a Georgian who dedicated his life to the advancement of agriculture in our state and across the world.</p>
<p>This year's honorees include Samuel Aggrey, recognized for Excellence in International Agricultural and Environmental Sciences; Kylee Jo Duberstein, recognized for Excellence in Teaching; Pam Knox, recognized for Excellence in Extension; Peggy Ozias-Akins, recognized for Excellence in Research; and Rachel Stewart, recognized for Excellence in Public Service Extension.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, Law</p>
<p>In 1994, Oregon voters passed the Death with Dignity Act, which legalized physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill. Since then, it has become legal in 4 more states, including New Mexico, where the state court ruling that it is constitutional is under appeal. Is it, in the words of the American Medical Association’s code of ethics, “fundamentally incompatible with the physician’s role as healer”? Will these laws lead to a slippery slope, where the vulnerable are pressured to choose death and human life is devalued? Or do we need to recognize everyone’s basic right to autonomy, the right to end pain and suffering, and the right to choose to die with dignity?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> October 22, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, U.S.</p>
<p>Income inequality has been on the rise for decades. In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. As the rungs of the economic ladder move further and further apart, conventional wisdom says that it will become much more difficult to climb them. Opportunities for upward mobility—the American dream—will disappear as the deck becomes stacked against the middle class and the poor. But others see inequality as a positive, a sign of a dynamic and robust economy that, in the end, helps everyone. And contrary to public opinion, mobility has remained stable over the past few decades. If the American dream is dying, is it the result of income inequality? Or is disparity in income a red herring where more complex issues are at play?</p>

<div><strong>Is the American Dream Attainable?</strong> <small>2023-03-23 02:26:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The American dream! Popularized by historian James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America, the term described that dream of a land in which life should be better richer, and fuller for everyone. After World War II, the American dream evolved into homeownership, a happy family, and summer vacations. Some people even aspired to get a degree. The G.I. Bill helped make the dream possible. That generation, known as the baby boomers, expected their children to do even better.</p>
<p>Why the American dream fades
In recent decades, the concept of the American dream has been deteriorating. Whereas upward mobility once seemed attainable for almost everyone, today's economy has left people struggling to afford basic necessities, let alone to save for their future. "Only half of today's 30-year-olds earn more than their parents when they were at the same age" according to Visual Capitalist (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/). No longer does having a good job with benefits equate to owning a home and having a family with two kids, a car, and a dog.</p>
<p>What has caused this shift? For starters: stagnating wage growth, uneven income distribution, increase in the cost of living, and erosion of benefits. Younger generations are forced to rethink the American dream and to accept that a 9-to-5 job is not enough. Americans should focus on building passive income that will complement and eventually replace their current wages. Let's take a look at the factors preventing upward mobility.</p>
<p>Stunted growth
According to a Venture Capitalist article (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/), the average hourly rate was $22.65 in 2018 versus $20.27 in 1964, after inflation adjustments. That represents a mere 11.7% increase over a span of 54 years, which represents a 0.2% annual increase above inflation.</p>
<p>A 2014 Economic Policy Institute analysis (https://www.epi.org/multimedia/income-inequality-american-dream-debate/) found that fewer people in the lower and middle classes were actually climbing the economic ladder today. In turn, they made less than their parents. As Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S (https://opentodebate.org/debates/income-inequality-impairs-american-dream-upward-mobility)reported, In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. What led to this phenomenon? Unequal income distribution, where those at the top receive much more than those on the bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of income stagnation and unequal income distribution are technology, automation, offshore resources, and independent contracting. More and more corporations are pushing governments and workers into a gig economy by allowing them to hire contractors and avoid the protection afforded to employees. The recent adoption of California Proposition 22 (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22) opens the gate to other companies using independent contractors rather than hiring employees.</p>
<p>Wage stagnation would not be a critical issue if prices had risen at the same rate as inflation, but that hasn't been the case. Health premiums rose 3% above inflation every year over 10 years, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation survey (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.1001?utm_campaign=HASU%3A+10-05-18+%28Copy%29&utm_medium=email&vgo_ee=TQLYTaMUxLuVgns98nuK7Q%3D%3D&utm_content=Health+Affairs++October+Issue%3A+Social+Determinants%2C+Drug+++Device+Prices+++More%3B+2018+Costs+For+Employer-Sponsored+Family+Health+Coverage%3B+Aftermath+Of+A+School+Shooting&utm_source=Newsletter&). That is not taking into account the independent contractors who would have to pay out of pocket often at a much higher premium than when working as an employee.</p>
<p>The average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a four-year institution (http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) rose from $16,590 in 1995 (in 2017 dollars) to $27,357 in 2017 a 2.3% annual increase above inflation. Median house prices have gone from $200,000 to $300,000 over the same period. That's a 1.8% increase on top of inflation. We are seeing similar trends in prices for child-car, gas, and cars all have drastically increased since 1990, while wages have practically stayed the same.</p>
<p>Creating a new dream
Not all hope is lost, however. Whereas previous generations could be complacent about their future, today's millennials and younger generations must take a more proactive approach to secure their dreams. As mentioned above, this requires a shift in mindset. Instead of focusing just on maintaining a 9-to-5 job and saving up for retirement, it would be wise to build passive income. Passive income can help you not just maintain your wealth but also continue to grow it and save toward your future.</p>
<p>There are many ways to earn passive income. My personal expertise is in turnkey rentals (http://marteleric.com/). Owning a turnkey single-family rental is a great, fast way to earn passive income while working or during retirement. Investing in a turnkey property means you buy a rental home or apartment that has already been fixed up and rented through a property management company. You buy it, managers run it, and you collect the profits.</p>
<p>The American dream is still alive. It just requires a shift in mindset and a more proactive approach. Whereas previous generations could be more complacent about their future, today you must take action or your standard of living could easily slide toward poverty. Acquiring passive income is the surest way to secure your future success.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> October 22, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, U.S.</p>
<p>Income inequality has been on the rise for decades. In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. As the rungs of the economic ladder move further and further apart, conventional wisdom says that it will become much more difficult to climb them. Opportunities for upward mobility—the American dream—will disappear as the deck becomes stacked against the middle class and the poor. But others see inequality as a positive, a sign of a dynamic and robust economy that, in the end, helps everyone. And contrary to public opinion, mobility has remained stable over the past few decades. If the American dream is dying, is it the result of income inequality? Or is disparity in income a red herring where more complex issues are at play?</p>

After World War II, the American dream evolved into homeownership, a happy family, and summer vacations. Some people even aspired to get a degree. The G.I. Bill helped make the dream possible. That generation, known as the baby boomers, expected their children to do even better.</p>
<p>Why the American dream fades
In recent decades, the concept of the American dream has been deteriorating. Whereas upward mobility once seemed attainable for almost everyone, today's economy has left people struggling to afford basic necessities, let alone to save for their future. "Only half of today's 30-year-olds earn more than their parents when they were at the same age" according to Visual Capitalist (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/). No longer does having a good job with benefits equate to owning a home and having a family with two kids, a car, and a dog.</p>
<p>What has caused this shift? For starters: stagnating wage growth, uneven income distribution, increase in the cost of living, and erosion of benefits. Younger generations are forced to rethink the American dream and to accept that a 9-to-5 job is not enough. Americans should focus on building passive income that will complement and eventually replace their current wages. Let's take a look at the factors preventing upward mobility.</p>
<p>Stunted growth
According to a Venture Capitalist article (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/), the average hourly rate was $22.65 in 2018 versus $20.27 in 1964, after inflation adjustments. That represents a mere 11.7% increase over a span of 54 years, which represents a 0.2% annual increase above inflation.</p>
<p>A 2014 Economic Policy Institute analysis (https://www.epi.org/multimedia/income-inequality-american-dream-debate/) found that fewer people in the lower and middle classes were actually climbing the economic ladder today. In turn, they made less than their parents. As Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S (https://opentodebate.org/debates/income-inequality-impairs-american-dream-upward-mobility)reported, In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. What led to this phenomenon? Unequal income distribution, where those at the top receive much more than those on the bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of income stagnation and unequal income distribution are technology, automation, offshore resources, and independent contracting. More and more corporations are pushing governments and workers into a gig economy by allowing them to hire contractors and avoid the protection afforded to employees. The recent adoption of California Proposition 22 (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22) opens the gate to other companies using independent contractors rather than hiring employees.</p>
<p>Wage stagnation would not be a critical issue if prices had risen at the same rate as inflation, but that hasn't been the case. Health premiums rose 3% above inflation every year over 10 years, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation survey (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.1001?utm_campaign=HASU%3A+10-05-18+%28Copy%29&utm_medium=email&vgo_ee=TQLYTaMUxLuVgns98nuK7Q%3D%3D&utm_content=Health+Affairs++October+Issue%3A+Social+Determinants%2C+Drug+++Device+Prices+++More%3B+2018+Costs+For+Employer-Sponsored+Family+Health+Coverage%3B+Aftermath+Of+A+School+Shooting&utm_source=Newsletter&). That is not taking into account the independent contractors who would have to pay out of pocket often at a much higher premium than when working as an employee.</p>
<p>The average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a four-year institution (http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) rose from $16,590 in 1995 (in 2017 dollars) to $27,357 in 2017 a 2.3% annual increase above inflation. Median house prices have gone from $200,000 to $300,000 over the same period. That's a 1.8% increase on top of inflation. We are seeing similar trends in prices for child-car, gas, and cars all have drastically increased since 1990, while wages have practically stayed the same.</p>
<p>Creating a new dream
Not all hope is lost, however. Whereas previous generations could be complacent about their future, today's millennials and younger generations must take a more proactive approach to secure their dreams. As mentioned above, this requires a shift in mindset. Instead of focusing just on maintaining a 9-to-5 job and saving up for retirement, it would be wise to build passive income. Passive income can help you not just maintain your wealth but also continue to grow it and save toward your future.</p>
<p>There are many ways to earn passive income. My personal expertise is in turnkey rentals (http://marteleric.com/). Owning a turnkey single-family rental is a great, fast way to earn passive income while working or during retirement. Investing in a turnkey property means you buy a rental home or apartment that has already been fixed up and rented through a property management company. You buy it, managers run it, and you collect the profits.</p>
<p>The American dream is still alive. It just requires a shift in mindset and a more proactive approach. Whereas previous generations could be more complacent about their future, today you must take action or your standard of living could easily slide toward poverty. Acquiring passive income is the surest way to secure your future success.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Tech</p>
<p>Some say that the mass collection of U.S. phone records is a gross invasion of privacy. Others say that it is necessary to keep us safe. But what does the U.S. Constitution say? "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Is collection of phone records a “search” or “seizure"? If so, is it “unreasonable”? Does it require a particularized warrant and probable cause? These are among the most consequential—and controversial—constitutional questions of our time.</p>

<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<p>Should all rape allegations involving college students be handled by the criminal-justice system? Or should campuses continue to use a separate disciplinary process, with different standards and sanctions, and give students who allege such incidents a choice of how to proceed?</p></div>

And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>The rise of ISIS, the disintegration of Iraq, Syria’s ongoing civil war, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the promise and peril of the Arab Spring... What role should America play in the Middle East? For some, America’s restraint has been a sign of disciplined leadership. But for others, it has been a sign of diminished strength and influence. How do we strike a balance between our national interests, moral obligations, and the maintenance of world order? Are we simply recognizing the limitations of our power, or does this embattled region require a bolder, more muscular, American presence?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>

And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Education, U.S.</p>
<p>In K-12 education, there is nothing more controversial than the Common Core State Standards, national academic standards in English and Math. Adopted by more than 40 states, they were developed, in part, to address concerns that American students were falling behind their foreign counterparts and graduating high school without the necessary skills for college and the workforce. But is this the reform we’ve been looking for? Has the federal government overreached and saddled our schools with standards that have been flawed from the start? Or will the Common Core raise the bar and improve the quality of our children’s education?</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the issue will land in the spotlight at the Yale Repertory Theatre as four debaters argue for or against the statement, Free speech is threatened on campus.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<p>Is independent political speech the linchpin of our democracy or its Achilles' heel?  For democracy to work, some say, citizens (and corporations, and unions, and media outlets, and other voluntary organizations) must be allowed to express their views on the issues, candidates, and elections of the day. This proposition, they say, is exactly why the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and of the press. On this view, restrictions on independent political speech undermine and subvert our constitutional structure. But others take a different view: If everyone can spend as much money as they like to express their political views, then some voices will be amplified, magnified and enhanced—while others will be all but drowned out. On this view, it is this inequality of influence that subverts our constitutional structure—and restrictions that level the playing field actually enhance rather than abridge the freedom of speech.</p>

<div><strong>In New York, Law School's Jeannie Suk Debates Title IX</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.</p>
<p>At the forum hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and titled Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<p>If consciousness is just the workings of neurons and synapses, how do we explain the phenomenon of near-death experience? By some accounts, about 3% of the U.S. population has had one: an out-of-body experience often characterized by remarkable visions and feelings of peace and joy, all while the physical body is close to death.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Tech</p>
<p>Millennials growing up with revolutionary technology and entering adulthood in a time of recession have recently been much maligned. Are their critics right? Is this generation uniquely coddled, narcissistic, and lazy? Or have we let conventional wisdom blind us to their openness to change and innovation, and optimism in the face of uncertainty, which, in any generation, are qualities to be admired?</p>

<div><strong>New Haven Debate Will Focus on Whether Free Speech Is Threatened on Campuses</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>

<p>On Tuesday, the issue will land in the spotlight at the Yale Repertory Theatre as four debaters argue for or against the statement, Free speech is threatened on campus.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

<div class='news-content'><p>The atmosphere on college campuses has changed, a Columbia University professor argued before an audience full of Yale students and New Haven residents Tuesday. And that change has created spaces in which free speech is not extinguished, but threatened.</p>
<p>A majority of the audience agreed.</p>
<p>After a debate hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonprofit that provides free online access to debates held across the country on issues facing society, 66 percent of the audience left convinced that free speech is threatened on college campuses. The event was held at the Yale Repertory Theatre.</p></div>

<p>In recent weeks, speakers such as conservative Ben Shapiro and anti-feminist Milo Yiannopoulos have faced angry crowds of progressive students who tried to shut down their campus speeches with interruptions and physical confrontations.</p>

<div><strong>The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate at Yale highlighted the disconnect between those who would downplay the problem, and the growing mass of evidence that they're wrong.</p>
<p>At a recentIntelligence Squared / Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/free-speech-threatened-campus/), an audience filled an auditorium at Yale University to weigh the timely proposition, 'Free speech is threatened on campus.' The debate concerned higher education generally, not just the host institution. And at the event's conclusion, having heard arguments on both sides of the question, 66 percent of the crowd agreed: free speech is threatened. That represented a 17-point shift from a poll taken as the event began. The evidence is that persuasive.</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>AEI's Scott Winship on Open to Debate: Will Millennials be Left Behind?</strong> <small>2023-07-12 16:53:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Millennials people born between 1981 and 1996 have surpassed the Baby Boomers as the largest generation group in the U.S. Now, the oldest Millennials are reaching their forties and feel they don’t have the financial and emotional standing their parents did and have instead been left behind. Those who agree say Millennials are America’s most educated but broke generation and pay more for basic items, making them unable to afford to buy a home or have children. Those who disagree say that not buying a house or having kids are their choices, not based on economic hardship, and really, they will soon be doing well financially because they strive for higher education and better jobs and they are close to reaching their peak earning years, which will help them earn more than the generations before them.</p>
<p>With this context, we ask the question: Will Millennials be Left Behind?</p>
<p>This debate between AEI’s Scott Winship and author Jill Filipovic was produced in front of a live audience, at the Comedy Cellar’s The Village Underground, on June 7, 2023.</p></div>]]></description>

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>AEI's Scott Winship on Open to Debate: Will Millennials be Left Behind?</strong> <small>2023-07-12 16:53:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Millennials people born between 1981 and 1996 have surpassed the Baby Boomers as the largest generation group in the U.S. Now, the oldest Millennials are reaching their forties and feel they don’t have the financial and emotional standing their parents did and have instead been left behind. Those who agree say Millennials are America’s most educated but broke generation and pay more for basic items, making them unable to afford to buy a home or have children. Those who disagree say that not buying a house or having kids are their choices, not based on economic hardship, and really, they will soon be doing well financially because they strive for higher education and better jobs and they are close to reaching their peak earning years, which will help them earn more than the generations before them.</p>
<p>With this context, we ask the question: Will Millennials be Left Behind?</p>
<p>This debate between AEI’s Scott Winship and author Jill Filipovic was produced in front of a live audience, at the Comedy Cellar’s The Village Underground, on June 7, 2023.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is the college of the future online? With the popularity of MOOCs (massive open online courses) and the availability of online degree programs at a fraction of their on-campus price, we are experiencing an exciting experiment in higher education. Does the traditional classroom stand a chance? Will online education be the great equalizer, or is a campus-based college experience still necessary?</p>

<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> World</p>
<p>Disarming Syria. Asylum for Edward Snowden. Arming Iran. Deploying troops to Crimea. Is Vladimir Putin flexing his muscles, while our own president fades into the background of world politics, or is it all a global game of smoke and mirrors? Russia is one of the world’s largest oil producers and has the power of veto on the U.N. Security Council, but it remains an authoritarian state, rife with corruption and economic struggles. Is our toxic relationship something to worry about, or is Putin’s Russia fading in importance?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Enemies? Frenemies? Debate on China-US Ties Concludes That War Isn't Imminent</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A former prime minister of Australia, a political science professor, and two senior members from United States-based think-tanks took turns at the lectern at a packed auditorium in Kaufman Music Center on Oct. 14 to debate a topic of the times: are China and the United States long-term enemies?</p></div>
<div><strong>Sino-US Ties: Prospects for Cooperation not Confrontation</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a debate held by "Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.", renowned international relations experts such as John J. Mearsheimer from the University of Chicago and former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd debated whether China and the US would become long-term enemies.

<div><strong>Debate: Are the U.S. and China Long-Term Enemies?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In a spirited Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on Wednesday night, Asia Society Policy Institute President Kevin Rudd and Kissinger Institute Director Robert Daly faced off with University of Chicago Professor John Mearsheimer and Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow Peter Brookes over this provocative motion: China and the U.S. are long-term enemies.</p></div>
<div><strong>Should 100,000 Syrian Refugees Come to America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>
<p>One of the first forays into understanding if it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America was Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on the subject of Should the US let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees?</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p>With the drone strike on accused terrorist and New Mexico-born Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, President Obama has tested the limits of the executive branch’s powers. Does the president have constitutional authority under the due process clause to kill U.S. citizens abroad, or is it a violation of this clause to unilaterally decide to target and kill Americans?</p>

<div><strong>Debate: Courts, not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Jed Rubenfeld and Jeannie Suk (for) and Michelle Anderson and Stephen Schulhofer (against) participated in an interesting and extensive debate on this question on September 16; video here. One of the most notable aspects of the discussion was the systematic doubt about the capacity of courts to be fair. Professor Suk noted that campus disciplinary proceedings had a disproportionate impact on the poor and minorities; Dean Anderson responded, to oversimplify, that Ferguson and other incidents make clear that the criminal justice system is worse. All sides agreed that there are excesses in campus discipline which are appropriately being weeded out in courts. Again, to oversimplify, Professor Schulhofer argued nevertheless that campus discipline was necessary for fairness to the accused; given draconian sexual assault sentences, the power of prosecutors, the pressure of sweet pleas, and the unreliability of juries, some form of accountability other than prosecution was necessary so that the lives of minor offenders (or alleged offenders) were not ruined. Taken together, I think most or all parties might agree that the criminal justice system has often been disrespectful of victims, dismissive of sexual assault claims, and also sometimes arbitrary and brutal to those charged with or convicted of sex offenses. If this is so, one wonders what makes the character or ability of professors and administrators so much higher that better results are likely in the academy.</p></div>

<p>Affirmative action, when used as a factor in college admissions, is meant to foster diversity and provide equal opportunities in education for underrepresented minorities. But is it achieving its stated goals and helping the population it was created to support? Its critics point to students struggling to keep up in schools mismatched to their abilities and to the fact that the policy can be manipulated to benefit affluent and middle class students who already possess many educational advantages. Is it time to overhaul or abolish affirmative action?</p>

<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>
<p>The debate can be seen in its entirety here (https://opentodebate.org/debate/dont-blame-teachers-unions-our-failing-schools/).</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate / Intelligence Squared U.S. Podcast Asks: Is Affirmative Action Unfair To Asian Americans?</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:13:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Affirmative action is one of those issues that nags at people, irrespective of their view on its efficacy. For some, affirmative action offends their sense of fairness and raises their emotional thermostat because someone’s cutting in line. For others, affirmative action is a remedy for a long-standing societal illness — discrimination against a group or multiple groups. Finally, other people view a college campus as a “Cobb salad,” where many different ingredients are tossed into one bowl and one delicious food item results. To them, a college campus of, say, only one kind of cheese is just wrong.</p>
<p>It should never be said that the people at the Open to Debate formerly, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. have shied away from a debate on a contentious issue. In fact, they know that it’s these issues that make for the most lively and edifying debates.</p>
<p>For some listeners, the concept of a debate may be an alien concept. Why? Because most media outlets, such as Fox News, allow one point of view, making their channel a “safe space” for the “one true political viewpoint.” When a contrary voice is invited on the network, they are often yelled at and talked over until they give up or the network goes to a commercial when that guest begins to score some debate points.</p>
<p>In real debates, people don’t yell or scream or call each other names. For millions, it will be an alien concept.</p>
<p>But listening to a true debate is a cleansing process. It’s like your intellect gets a good deep scrubbing. Lies are washed away. Alternative facts are not allowed. Insults have no place. Suddenly, your entire belief system is hosed down and then rebooted back to its factory default.</p>
<p>With that preface, the new episode of nonpartisan debate podcast Intelligence Squared U.S. asks a provocative question: “Is Affirmative Action Unfair to Asian Americans?”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is likely to issue a ruling related to this topic in the coming months, having recently heard arguments in the case Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, Intelligence Squared presents arguments on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>“Arguments on both sides of the issue.” A novel concept these days, but, oh, so refreshing.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion is Lee Cheng, Co-founder of the Asian American Coalition for Education who also worked in the Harvard College admissions process as an alumni interviewer for nearly 25 years. Arguing against is John Yang, President of Asian Americans Advancing Justice who has worked with the White House and Senate in securing the nomination and confirmation of over 20 Asian American and Pacific Islander federal judges.</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>

<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>Open to Debate / Intelligence Squared U.S. Podcast Asks: Is Affirmative Action Unfair To Asian Americans?</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:13:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Affirmative action is one of those issues that nags at people, irrespective of their view on its efficacy. For some, affirmative action offends their sense of fairness and raises their emotional thermostat because someone’s cutting in line. For others, affirmative action is a remedy for a long-standing societal illness — discrimination against a group or multiple groups. Finally, other people view a college campus as a “Cobb salad,” where many different ingredients are tossed into one bowl and one delicious food item results. To them, a college campus of, say, only one kind of cheese is just wrong.</p>
<p>It should never be said that the people at the Open to Debate formerly, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. have shied away from a debate on a contentious issue. In fact, they know that it’s these issues that make for the most lively and edifying debates.</p>
<p>For some listeners, the concept of a debate may be an alien concept. Why? Because most media outlets, such as Fox News, allow one point of view, making their channel a “safe space” for the “one true political viewpoint.” When a contrary voice is invited on the network, they are often yelled at and talked over until they give up or the network goes to a commercial when that guest begins to score some debate points.</p>
<p>In real debates, people don’t yell or scream or call each other names. For millions, it will be an alien concept.</p>
<p>But listening to a true debate is a cleansing process. It’s like your intellect gets a good deep scrubbing. Lies are washed away. Alternative facts are not allowed. Insults have no place. Suddenly, your entire belief system is hosed down and then rebooted back to its factory default.</p>
<p>With that preface, the new episode of nonpartisan debate podcast Intelligence Squared U.S. asks a provocative question: “Is Affirmative Action Unfair to Asian Americans?”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is likely to issue a ruling related to this topic in the coming months, having recently heard arguments in the case Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, Intelligence Squared presents arguments on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>“Arguments on both sides of the issue.” A novel concept these days, but, oh, so refreshing.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion is Lee Cheng, Co-founder of the Asian American Coalition for Education who also worked in the Harvard College admissions process as an alumni interviewer for nearly 25 years. Arguing against is John Yang, President of Asian Americans Advancing Justice who has worked with the White House and Senate in securing the nomination and confirmation of over 20 Asian American and Pacific Islander federal judges.</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S., World</p>
<p>Has Edward Snowden done the U.S. a great service? There is no doubt that his release of highly classified stolen documents has sparked an important public debate, even forcing what could be a major presidential overhaul of the NSA’s surveillance programs. But have his actions—which include the downloading of an estimated 1.7 million files—tipped off our enemies and endangered national security? Is Snowden a whistleblower, or is he a criminal?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>

<div><strong>Is It Reasonable to Resettle Refugees in America?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Syrian refugee crisis coinciding with America's Presidential Campaigns has brought the emotional debate over refugees into the political arenas of nearly every state and over the internet. Candidates and conservative journalists have placed fear of terrorism and radicalization in front of voters while liberals in this country and abroad use compassion and sympathy in an attempt to play the heartstrings of ordinarily big-hearted Americans. While Women of the World obviously believes in our capacity to serve refugees and ensure their benefit to society and has few barriers to the amazing stories of survival of our new refugee neighbors, we want to win both hearts and minds, to show that it is reasonable to resettle refugees in America.</p>

<p>Has Edward Snowden done the U.S. a great service? There is no doubt that his release of highly classified stolen documents has sparked an important public debate, even forcing what could be a major presidential overhaul of the NSA’s surveillance programs. But have his actions—which include the downloading of an estimated 1.7 million files—tipped off our enemies and endangered national security? Is Snowden a whistleblower, or is he a criminal?</p>

<div><strong>Obama's Iran Deal is Good for America: A Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday evening, I attended a debate in New York City sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. focusing on whether or not Obama's Iran deal is good for the country. (The podcast is available at the website.)</p>
<p>On the pro side of the debate (for more complete bios on the debaters, visit the IQ2 / Open to Debate website) was Philip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, former special assistant to the president, and White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf Region. He was joined by Thomas Pickering, currently vice chairman of an international consulting firm but more notable for his time served as a diplomat in various ambassadorships including to the U.N.</p></div>
<div><strong>How to Win the Iran Argument</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the heart of blue America ' New York City ' Mark Dubowitz and Mike Doran debated Philip Gordon and Thomas Pickering on whether the Iran deal is good for the United States. The way these things work is that the side that moves opinion the most from pre- to post-debate polling wins. In this case, Dubowitz and Doran won, moving opinion against the deal from 19 to 43 percent. The deal defenders gained just 13 points (from 37 to 50 percent).</p>
<p>The debate is hugely instructive and entertaining and can be viewed in its entirety, but I will note some high points and try to draw some lessons for future debates in and outside Congress.</p></div>
<div><strong>Geopolitical Expert Ian Bremmer on the Choices America Faces</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Q: You seemed to argue at an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate, that the US cannot be the world police anymore. How does this notion fit into your idea of an Indispensable America?</p>
<p>Bremmer: I did argue that (though they assign you the position... and any good debater should be able to analytically handle that). But I think Indispensable America is becoming much more challenging. US allies are less capable/willing to support. US adversaries are more willing to challenge. And the willingness of the American people to pay the tab in blood and treasure is decreasing. I'd be much more comfortable with Indispensable America if I believed we could actually follow through on it.</p></div>
<div><strong>Do We Have an ISIS Strategy?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That the debate surrounding ISIS seems confused was recently echoed in an actual debate on the topic. The folks at Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. recently held a formal Oxford Union-style debate at the Aspen Security Forum. The proposition being debated was Containment is not enough: ISIS must be defeated. The outcome wasn't surprising, but the arguments were. All four debaters agreed that ISIS had to be fought militarily, ideologically, and in what stands for public opinion these days: social media. The only real question was: What is America's role?</p></div>
<div><strong>Between Iraq and a Hawk Base</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>That tension between steadfast principles and hard realities, both at home and abroad, was on display when some of America's leading foreign-policy thinkers gathered for a retreat hosted by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan education and policy organization, in August. The conference's main event was an hour-long debate about ISIS. Each debate team featured two national security officials from the Bush and Obama administrations. One team, Philip Zelikow, a former counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Michale Flournoy, Obama's former defense undersecretary of defense for policy, argued that ISIS should be defeated, including through military means. The other team, Dov Zakheim, Bush's former Defense Department comptroller and foreign ­policy adviser, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, Obama's director of policy planning for the State Department, argued that it should be contained until it collapsed under the weight of its own failed ideology, as occurred with the Soviet Union. Among the 200 spectators were retired general David Petraeus, the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Jeb Bush's outside adviser, Richard Fontaine.</p>
<p>The debate was spirited and replete with unintended ironies. There was Flournoy, the former Obama official, arguing the traditional neocon position that the only way to give the lie to ISIS's ideology was to take territory away from ISIS And there was Zakheim, the former Bush official, sounding decidedly noninterventionist: The issue is, can you and are you willing to send in hundreds of thousands of troops? Do you think this country wants to do that? Do you think we even want to spend money to do that?</p>
<p>Zakheim's realpolitik warning hit the audience like a bucket of cold water. Even the nation's most intellectually rigorous foreign thinkers seemed struck by the challenge of convincing the American public that war against ISIS would not entail a horrific reprise of the Iraq war. Surveyed before the debate began, 52 percent of attendees believed that ISIS should be destroyed, with 27 percent saying it should be contained and another 21 percent being undecided. After the debate, the audience underwent a reversal: 59 percent were now convinced that the proper course of action was to contain ISIS rather than to pour blood and treasure into an attempt to destroy it.</p></div>
