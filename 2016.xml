<p>Almost everyone can think of something they would like to change in the U.S. Constitution.  Some would like to update it to fit new technologies and evolving social mores.  Others think the Supreme Court has illegitimately “updated” it too much already, and would like to restore its original meaning.  Either way, it is always tempting to invoke Article V to amend the Constitution — to “fix" it, or “restore" it, or “improve" it.  But, on the other hand, there is a substantial risk to tinkering with the Constitution:  many amendments seem to have unintended consequences.  And calling a convention for proposing amendments is even riskier, because it has never been done before — and it might inadvertently put the entire constitutional structure up for grabs.  Is it worth the risk?  Should the states call a convention to amend the Constitution?

<p>At last night’s Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate (presented in conjunction with the National Constitution Center), Professor Lawrence Lessig and Tea Partier Mark Meckler argued that there are “big ticket” constitutional items facing America that Congress cannot and will not as a matter of political will, special interest capture, and/or political expedience tackle and the people need to call a convention to take that power back. To use an example near and dear to Professor Lessig’s heart, campaign spending is virtually unfettered right now and protected by this Supreme Court’s reading of the First Amendment despite broad, bipartisan support among average citizens.

<div><strong>Justice Breyer Dismantles Originalism Like It Deserves Respect. It Doesn’t.</strong> <small>2025-07-08 15:31:26</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The former justice aims to elevate the conversation. It should be pounded into the Earth.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer may no longer sit on the Supreme Court, but he still has thoughts about his old workplace. Tomorrow, Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/) (Opens in a new window)is dropping a wide-ranging interview with Breyer covering everything from his personal account of the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court to the mechanics of the conversations justices have.</p>
<p>He also gives his secret strategy for making sure he’d get assigned an opinion with just three little words.</p>
<p>However, a good deal of the conversation explores themes from his latest book Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism Not Textualism. Breyer’s book and the related discussion provide a frustrating take on judicial philosophy. Not because the justice fails to lay out intellectual case against either textualism or originalism, but because he addresses them with the respect they have done nothing to deserve.</p>
<p>There’s nobility in raising the level of discourse through professional and respectful engagement. But it’s also the kind of nobility that gets offed in the first season of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>It’s a matter of victory conditions. Textualists don’t care about convincing everybody, they just need their trash ideas treated “fairly” by respected people so they can pawn off their worldview as reasonable disagreement. Defenestration via Overton Window.</p>
<p>Efforts to unilaterally elevate the conversation miss the mark because they fail to grasp this victory condition issue. The conservative legal movement doesn’t care that you can respectfully poke holes in their chosen interpretive philosophy — they more or less know it sucks — they just want it treated with unearned dignity on the public stage so they can trade on the patina of credibility that affords.</p>
<p>The Open to Debate crew notes that they recorded a prior debate titled “Should SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, focus on the original meaning of the Constitution?” and I know that because I was on that one! (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-scotus-focus-on-the-original-meaning-of-the-constitution/) (Opens in a new window)I recall Professor Randy Barnett laid out “five normative arguments” for originalism and I was allowed to ask a question at the end prompting him to concede his “number one” argument. If only I’d been able to ask more questions, we could’ve knocked them all out! But the point is even the defender of originalism was willing, when pressed, to admit he wasn’t even persuaded by the top argument he presented. It’s just throwing pasta on the wall and hoping the other side is polite about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean forfeiting critique or descending into Twitter-thread invective. Refusing to engage is its own vice. But tone matters. If the argument registers as polite disagreement rather than scathing teardown, textualists can declare mission accomplished.</p>
<p>If there’s a quote from the discussion that captures this disconnect, it’s this one:
So if you, you say to the textualists, what, uh, “Do you agree with Brown versus Board of Education?” They say, “Yes, of course.”
Ahem.</p>
<p>This isn’t hyperbole. During the first Trump administration, Democrats took to asking his judicial nominees if they would at the very least agree that Brown v. Board was correct and they… struggled mightily (https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/originalists-do-not-think-segregation-was-unconstitutional-and-wish-youd-stop-bothering-them-about-it/) (Opens in a new window). They weren’t being asked if Brown required a return of bussing or anything, just if — on its own facts — they agreed with the unanimous Supreme Court opinion against Jim Crow education. Koosh balls aren’t even that soft. And yet it caused much hemming and hawing among Trump’s nominees. Indeed, the counsel shepherding GOP nominees through the Judiciary Committee at the time threw a tantrum that it was unfair “gutter politics” to make nominees defend desegregation while under oath (https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/asking-about-brown-v-board-is-gutter-politics-according-to-senate-judiciary-official/) (Opens in a new window).</p>
<p>So when Justice Breyer grants the champions of textualism and originalism the benefit of the doubt that they would “of course” say they support Brown, he doesn’t grasp the conservative legal movement’s YOLO era where they’ve stopped pretending and just raw dog judicial review. There are certainly still originalist wizards willing to offer lip service to Brown ending de jure segregation while playing semantic games to guarantee de facto segregation, but for a lot of them the hood is now off. Or on as the case may be.</p>
<p>Either way, it renders this academic sparring session with textualism a naive exercise. He’s saying they would say “of course” as if these folks have some good faith belief in Brown, when recent events make pretty clear the movement only ever said “of course” to further the con that their philosophy had any depth to it.</p>
<p>The whole approach feels like chiding Orval Faubus that his articulation of states’ rights misreads the Federalist Papers. As the ubiquitous goose meme would ask, “A STATE’S RIGHT TO DO WHAT?!? (https://x.com/KleptocratWorld/status/1740286530814415237?lang=ar) (Opens in a new window)” The point forcefully expressed by our feathered friend is that the philosophy is inextricable from its purpose. That’s the nut that an academic conversation about this stuff can’t get at: originalism’s whole appeal is that constitutional law was better in the 1700s. “For who?” the goose might ask. Which is wrong because it should be “for whom” but geese are terrible at grammar. But when someone decides they’re an originalist, you can’t haggle with them over finer points of workability — valid though those points may be — because they’re in it for the value it represents. They’re in it because they actually believe in a backward-looking world. Tear down originalism from the ivory towers and they’ll just invent a new mechanism to get there.</p>
<p>Which is all to say the conversation is interesting but incomplete. Until someone in Breyer’s position delivers their sharp argument without conceding the textualist/originalist covert demand for respectability, these discussions do little to derail the steady advance of a jurisprudence of witch-hunters (https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/just-look-who-alito-cites-in-his-opinion-overturning-roe/) (Opens in a new window).</p>

Taking out Osama bin Laden, disengaging from fights in the Middle East that America cannot win, defusing the threat of a nuclear Iran, and refocusing our attention and resources to Asia, where our greatest opportunities and biggest long-term challenges are located.  But for others, it has been marked by missteps and retreat—pulling back where action and leadership was needed, and presiding over policies that strengthened our adversaries and disheartened our friends.   Has Obama’s foreign policy been a success?</p>

<p>It is alleged that the practice of gerrymandering —dividing election districts into units to favor a particular group— subverts democracy by making congressional districts “safe” for one party or the other.  As a result, only those voting in primaries are in effect choosing our representatives.   Are primary voters more extreme in their views, and therefore pulling democrats to the left and republicans to the right?  Or is the impact of gerrymandering actually overblown, while other more divisive contributing factors like the emergence of ideologically charged TV and radio outlets, the role of the internet and social network “echo chambers,” and campaign finance practices are in fact the real drivers of increasing partisanship?  If gerrymandering is a major problem, is there policy or constitutional principles that might be part of the solution?

<div><strong>Florida's legal fight used in academic debate over impact of redistricting</strong> <small>2016-11-15 21:39:10</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>TALLAHASSEE - Florida's three-year redistricting legal challenge was part of a debate Monday over whether or not the redrawing of political lines is creating a more polarized political environment.</p>
<p>The event, sponsored by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=4d8c4a6f6b3d7aa1c36e2d2470d6ecd400a98270a47aa5e02f70b3a8f41d7e2c), is part of non-partisan debate series that aims to "restore civility, reasoned analysis, and constructive public discourse to today's media landscape."</p>
<p>The debate, held at George Washington University, featured two teams arguing over whether or not redistricting is "destroying the political center."</p>
<p>The side arguing that it does used the last round of redistricting in Florida, which was steeped in political intrigue and lengthy court battles, as proof.</p>
<p>The new lines were drawn after voters approved a 2010 constitutional amendment that aimed to take politics out of the redistricting process. As part of a lawsuit filed by outside voting rights groups, however, it became clear that Republican operatives had met to work on strategies to draw favorable maps even with the new constitutional language in place.</p>
<p>"It did not take but a couple of weeks for the smartest Republicans strategists in the state... to gather at GOP headquarters in Tallahassee with legislative leaders and top aides," said David Daley, a former editor-and-chief of Salon who recently wrote a book 'Ratfucked:" The Influence of Redistricting.'</p>
<p>During the debate, a transcript of which was provided to POLITICO Florida, he joined Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, in arguing that redistricting was hurting the political center.</p>
<p>A feature of the argument was the secret meetings held by GOP operatives leading up to Florida's 2012 redistricting process.</p>
<p>"The goal, launching a sophisticated and highly concealed campaign to run two redistricting processes in Florida, one public, and the other in the shadows," Daley said. "Both in their control and loaded with partisan intent."</p>
<p>Ultimately, the courts tossed out state Senate and congressional maps drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature and ordered them to be redone.</p>
<p>The team arguing against the idea that redistricting was hurting the political center included Republican strategist Chris Jankowski and Princeton professor Nolan McCarty. They argued, in part, that voter attitudes themselves - not how the lines are drawn - have negatively impacted the political center.</p>
<p>"Six in 10 Americans think that the other party, should they get complete control, would threaten the very foundations of the country - the well-being," said Jankowski, who ran a program called Red Map on behalf of the Republican State Leadership Committee.</p>
<p>He also argued against the idea of removing map-drawing from state Legislatures because they are "accountable to voters."</p>
<p>"I think that it's an inherently political function to draw these lines," he said. "If you go back to our founders of the constitution, they tended to put the inherently political thing into the hands of political people."</p>
<p>That argument ultimately won the debate by wide-margin because it convinced "more of the audience over the course of the debate," wrote Ray Padgett, the group's spokesman, in an email.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> October 26, 2016</p>
<p>There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, and the question of what to do with them has sparked years of fierce debate, but no significant action.  In 2013, the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” managed to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate, only to get it dropped by the House.  And in 2016, a deadlocked Supreme Court decision stalled President Obama’s executive actions, DACA and DAPA, which would have saved 5 million from deportation.  For voters, on this issue, the choice between presidential candidates could not be clearer.  Should we give these immigrants a chance to earn citizenship through a process that would include paying a penalty, passing a security check, and getting in the back of the line? Or are we rewarding them for breaking the rules, and encouraging more of the same?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> October 26, 2016</p>
<p>There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, and the question of what to do with them has sparked years of fierce debate, but no significant action.  In 2013, the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” managed to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate, only to get it dropped by the House.  And in 2016, a deadlocked Supreme Court decision stalled President Obama’s executive actions, DACA and DAPA, which would have saved 5 million from deportation.  For voters, on this issue, the choice between presidential candidates could not be clearer.  Should we give these immigrants a chance to earn citizenship through a process that would include paying a penalty, passing a security check, and getting in the back of the line? Or are we rewarding them for breaking the rules, and encouraging more of the same?  Do they make positive contributions to the economy and complement our workforce, or do they burden taxpayers and create unwanted competition for jobs?  Should we give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship?</p>

<p>Health care costs in the U.S. are some 18 percent of GNP, nearly double what other rich countries spend. We read of drug therapies that cost $100,000 a year or more, and of drug price increases that are 6 times the rate of inflation, on average, and often much more when mergers reduce competition in the industry. Is this a major driver of excessive health care costs?</p>

<div><strong>As a Republican Jew, Am I Committing Political Suicide by Opposing Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:52:24</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Glick brings up an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate held in Manhattan last week. The subject was “Blame the elites for the Trump phenomenon.” All four debaters were conservatives who are, within a range, anti-Trump. Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney and The Federalist’s Ben Domenech were on the side blaming the elites for Trump’s rise. Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin and Wall Street Journal’s Bret Stephens opposed that view, mostly arguing that the voters share some of the blame.</p>
<p>I was at that debate. I walked in siding with Rubin and Stephens. But Carney and Domenech presented the stronger argument and, in the end, I voted for their side.</p>
<p>When it comes to Trump, there’s a lot of blame to go around. The media, elites, voters, all of us are responsible for this sideshow being the nominee and possible president of the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>Twilight of American Jewry</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:50:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Two sides debated the proposition that the American elites are to blame for Trump’s rise. Arguing in favor of the proposition were two Christian journalists Tim Carney and Ben Domenech.</p>
<p>Arguing against it were two Jewish journalists Bret Stephens (a former Jerusalem Posteditor-in-chief) and Jennifer Rubin.</p>
<p>Both Rubin and Stephens voiced their support for Clinton’s controversial assertion that half of Trump’s supporters are deplorable, unworthy of attention, un-American, and irredeemable.</p>
<p>For their part, Domenech and Carney argued that Stephens and Rubin were ignoring the social and economic dislocation of the lower middle class. They argued that the suffering of members of this group has caused millions of Americans to feel betrayed by their political elites and turn to Trump to put a stop to a political game they believe is rigged against them.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the way through the event, Carney brought up religion.</p></div>
<div><strong>Are Elites to Blame for Trump’s Political Success? Yes, According to a New York Debate Audience</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:36:35</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The nonprofit debate organization Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. facilitated a remarkable spectacle (https://opentodebate.org/debates/blame-elites-trump-phenomenon) Tuesday evening: two elite conservative media pundits arguing that the failures of their social and economic class are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump and for his winning by a large margin.</p>
<p>Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist (http://thefederalist.com/) and host of “The Federalist Radio Hour (http://thefederalist.com/tag/podcast/),” began by sounding like historian and author Thomas Frank (http://www.truthdig.com/tag/thomas+frank). Frank’s latest book, “Listen, Liberal (http://www.truthdig.com/tag/listen_liberal),” accused Democrats of ignoring the plight of the working class.</p>
<p>Trump “is neither a disease nor a symptom,” Domenech said. “He is a beta test for a cure. Americans are turning to him because he represents the breakdown of the post-Cold War left/right politics of the nation, a breakdown that has been happening in slow motion for the past two decades, fueled by a dramatic decline of trust in America’s elites.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Myself On Trump And The Elites</strong> <small>2016-09-16 18:40:00</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday, Tim Carney and I won the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on the proposition “Blame The Elites For The Trump Phenomenon” by a significant margin. Undecideds broke for our side of the proposition by more than 4-to-1. You can watch the full unedited debate here. (http://vlt.tc/2jtg) Jennifer Rubin and Bret Stephens had already been chosen as the Against debaters when the Intelligence Squared folks contacted me. Stephens in particular is an experienced debater, and so I expected a challenge. But the tactics they took in this debate surprised me for a number of reasons. Their primary approach was, essentially, Hillary Clinton’s to frame the negative economic plight of many millions of voters and their families and friends as an exaggeration or mere noise, and to instead focus on the “basket of deplorables” racism and misogyny as driving forces for Trump. I was particularly surprised that Stephens closed by reading an anti-Semitic tweet and Rubin closed by arguing our argument was fundamentally leftist these are not solid approaches to winning a debate. Blaming the voters for being racist or leftist is a weaker argument than others that could’ve been made.</p></div>
<div><strong>Media, political elites faulted for enabling Trump’s rise</strong> <small>2016-09-15 20:04:47</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Media and political elites, not rank-and-file voters, are responsible for the unlikely rise of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That was the overwhelming consensus among attendees at Tuesday’s season opener of Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org), the Oxford-style debate series in which four journalists defend or challenge a given prompt. In New York City on Tuesday, it was a premise familiar to 2016 politicos: Blame the Elites for the Trump Phenomenon.</p>
<p>When several hundred paying attendees weighed in at the event’s start, the majority were undecided, with about 30 percent siding with each opposing view. But by night’s end, The Federalist’s Ben Domenech (http://thefederalist.com/author/bdomenech/) and The Washington Examiner’s Timothy Carney (http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/timothy-p.-carney) emerged victorious, convincing 58 percent of the audience that the widespread failure of elites at the helm of America’s once-cherished institutions, not the inherent appeal of Trump’s anti-immigrant or anti-minority viewpoints, have enabled his success.</p></div>
<div><strong>Who Is To Blame For Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-15 20:01:40</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It’s a testament to a flagging campaign when thought leaders from your own party gather to hold a debate on who they should blame for your very existence. Donald Trump may be closing some of the gap in this horse race, but he’s still a long shot, and the conservative intelligentsia think it’s high time to start pointing fingers. Who are we to doubt them?</p>
<p>Like Saturn, the Reagan Revolution is eating its children, and it’s a spectacle to behold.</p>
<p>That’s what transpired last night when Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org) hosted its latest debate. T.P. Carney (http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/timothy-p.-carney) and Ben Domenech (http://thefederalist.com/author/bdomenech/) argued that Donald Trump is the natural result of a Republican party elite that perennially promises working-class whites the world and is shocked when those people stop trusting the party elites. On the other side, Jennifer Rubin (https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jennifer-rubin) and Bret Stephens (http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/bret-stephens/5463) argued that the Trump voters themselves are to blame.</p></div>
<div><strong>Are 'Elites' to Blame for the Rise of Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-14 18:02:29</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Who is at fault for the Donald Trump phenomenon? An audience of New York elites attended a debate on Tuesday night in Manhattan and ultimately delivered a surprising verdict.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens began his opening argument at the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org) event by noting that those sitting in the crowd at the Kaufman Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side are themselves the so-called elites. How many had traveled to Europe in the last five years? How many had graduate degrees? How many knew whether Sancerre was red or white wine?</p>
<p>As the majority of the audience raised their hands, he said, "I hate to break it to you, but you are the elite."</p></div>
<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer. As we now know, the inspector general of the State Department did not find she had violated any criminal laws and FBI Director James Comey – no Hillary Clinton fan – agreed that not one of the 33,000 emails she transferred to her private server contained recognizable classified markings.</p>
<p>But that example cuts both ways. Yes, it is obviously hypocritical for Trump and his supporters to scream about due process in the Colorado case. But Mrs. Clinton’s example also shows why due process is so important. She was never convicted of anything. And, so far at least, neither has Trump.</p>
<p>Winning a criminal insurrection conspiracy case won’t be a cakewalk for Special Counsel Jack Smith. I say this because on Dec. 14 I participated as playing Smith’s role as “prosecutor” in a mock trial sponsored by the nationally respected nonprofit organization Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/). Our mock argument was live-streamed last week, but it can be heard again on Jan. 5, 2024, the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection effort, on an NPR local affiliate; seen and heard on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AQxFtqh-4); on opentodebate.org; or on available podcast channels.</p>
<p>During this mock trial, the Trump side was represented by Sara Azari (https://www.azarilaw.com/sara-azari), a Los Angeles-based defense lawyer. Sara argued not only the absence of a smoking gun admission or written evidence by Trump that he knew he had lost the election; she also effectively argued that Trump’s claims, though false, are protected as political speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>My response was that the First Amendment does not protect lies that are part of a criminal conspiracy. I pointed out that there will be testimony from several people that Trump admitted he had lost but lied about it. However, I also pointed out that a jury can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the voter fraud did not cost him the election because the highest officials of his government, whom he appointed, all told him he had lost, including the attorney general, senior Justice Department officials, the director of national intelligence, and every single state official in the key battleground states whom he called. Georgia’s secretary of state of told him he had lost after three separate recounts. Still Trump asked him to “find” one vote more than the total Biden was found to have won Georgia – proving he knew he was asking the secretary of state to lie.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that 61 out of 61 state court judges rejected his claim that he had lost these key battleground states because of voter fraud. (Once in Pennsylvania, a court found some voter fraud, but that judge also ruled it wasn’t significant enough to change the outcome in that state).</p>
<p>In any event, there will and must be a test of Donald Trump’s culpability, but that must come in a trial, with due process by a finder of fact that reaches a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. America cannot accept a verdict barring Trump from running for office based on a court hearing 1,500 miles from Washington, D.C., without a trial, on a civil court standard of “preponderance of the evidence” – meaning anything above 50%.</p>
<p>Those of us who oppose Trump can beat him at the ballot box, especially if and when he is convicted of felonies in one or more of the criminal trials he faces in federal and state courts. Colorado’s chief justice was right in his dissent when he concluded Trump should not be barred by a state court “in the absence of an insurrection-related conviction” – the latter word meaning after a trial and a jury of his peers finds the defendant guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Lanny Davis is the founder of the Washington, D.C., law firm, Lanny J. Davis & Associates. He is one of the first to use the concept of legal crisis management to solve client problems – operating at the intersection of law, media, and politics. He is a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton in 1996-98 and served on a privacy and civil liberties panel appointed by President George W. Bush. He has been writing his “Purple Nation” column for more than 13 years.</p></div>

<div><strong>As a Republican Jew, Am I Committing Political Suicide by Opposing Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:52:24</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Glick brings up an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate held in Manhattan last week. The subject was “Blame the elites for the Trump phenomenon.” All four debaters were conservatives who are, within a range, anti-Trump. Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney and The Federalist’s Ben Domenech were on the side blaming the elites for Trump’s rise. Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin and Wall Street Journal’s Bret Stephens opposed that view, mostly arguing that the voters share some of the blame.</p>
<p>I was at that debate. I walked in siding with Rubin and Stephens. But Carney and Domenech presented the stronger argument and, in the end, I voted for their side.</p>
<p>When it comes to Trump, there’s a lot of blame to go around. The media, elites, voters, all of us are responsible for this sideshow being the nominee and possible president of the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>Twilight of American Jewry</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:50:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Two sides debated the proposition that the American elites are to blame for Trump’s rise. Arguing in favor of the proposition were two Christian journalists Tim Carney and Ben Domenech.</p>
<p>Arguing against it were two Jewish journalists Bret Stephens (a former Jerusalem Posteditor-in-chief) and Jennifer Rubin.</p>
<p>Both Rubin and Stephens voiced their support for Clinton’s controversial assertion that half of Trump’s supporters are deplorable, unworthy of attention, un-American, and irredeemable.</p>
<p>For their part, Domenech and Carney argued that Stephens and Rubin were ignoring the social and economic dislocation of the lower middle class. They argued that the suffering of members of this group has caused millions of Americans to feel betrayed by their political elites and turn to Trump to put a stop to a political game they believe is rigged against them.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the way through the event, Carney brought up religion.</p></div>
<div><strong>Are Elites to Blame for Trump’s Political Success? Yes, According to a New York Debate Audience</strong> <small>2016-09-22 14:36:35</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The nonprofit debate organization Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. facilitated a remarkable spectacle (https://opentodebate.org/debates/blame-elites-trump-phenomenon) Tuesday evening: two elite conservative media pundits arguing that the failures of their social and economic class are responsible for the rise of Donald Trump and for his winning by a large margin.</p>
<p>Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist (http://thefederalist.com/) and host of “The Federalist Radio Hour (http://thefederalist.com/tag/podcast/),” began by sounding like historian and author Thomas Frank (http://www.truthdig.com/tag/thomas+frank). Frank’s latest book, “Listen, Liberal (http://www.truthdig.com/tag/listen_liberal),” accused Democrats of ignoring the plight of the working class.</p>
<p>Trump “is neither a disease nor a symptom,” Domenech said. “He is a beta test for a cure. Americans are turning to him because he represents the breakdown of the post-Cold War left/right politics of the nation, a breakdown that has been happening in slow motion for the past two decades, fueled by a dramatic decline of trust in America’s elites.</p></div>
<div><strong>Debating Myself On Trump And The Elites</strong> <small>2016-09-16 18:40:00</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday, Tim Carney and I won the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate on the proposition “Blame The Elites For The Trump Phenomenon” by a significant margin. Undecideds broke for our side of the proposition by more than 4-to-1. You can watch the full unedited debate here. (http://vlt.tc/2jtg) Jennifer Rubin and Bret Stephens had already been chosen as the Against debaters when the Intelligence Squared folks contacted me. Stephens in particular is an experienced debater, and so I expected a challenge. But the tactics they took in this debate surprised me for a number of reasons. Their primary approach was, essentially, Hillary Clinton’s to frame the negative economic plight of many millions of voters and their families and friends as an exaggeration or mere noise, and to instead focus on the “basket of deplorables” racism and misogyny as driving forces for Trump. I was particularly surprised that Stephens closed by reading an anti-Semitic tweet and Rubin closed by arguing our argument was fundamentally leftist these are not solid approaches to winning a debate. Blaming the voters for being racist or leftist is a weaker argument than others that could’ve been made.</p></div>
<div><strong>Media, political elites faulted for enabling Trump’s rise</strong> <small>2016-09-15 20:04:47</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Media and political elites, not rank-and-file voters, are responsible for the unlikely rise of Donald Trump.</p>
<p>That was the overwhelming consensus among attendees at Tuesday’s season opener of Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org), the Oxford-style debate series in which four journalists defend or challenge a given prompt. In New York City on Tuesday, it was a premise familiar to 2016 politicos: Blame the Elites for the Trump Phenomenon.</p>
<p>When several hundred paying attendees weighed in at the event’s start, the majority were undecided, with about 30 percent siding with each opposing view. But by night’s end, The Federalist’s Ben Domenech (http://thefederalist.com/author/bdomenech/) and The Washington Examiner’s Timothy Carney (http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/timothy-p.-carney) emerged victorious, convincing 58 percent of the audience that the widespread failure of elites at the helm of America’s once-cherished institutions, not the inherent appeal of Trump’s anti-immigrant or anti-minority viewpoints, have enabled his success.</p></div>
<div><strong>Who Is To Blame For Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-15 20:01:40</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It’s a testament to a flagging campaign when thought leaders from your own party gather to hold a debate on who they should blame for your very existence. Donald Trump may be closing some of the gap in this horse race, but he’s still a long shot, and the conservative intelligentsia think it’s high time to start pointing fingers. Who are we to doubt them?</p>
<p>Like Saturn, the Reagan Revolution is eating its children, and it’s a spectacle to behold.</p>
<p>That’s what transpired last night when Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org) hosted its latest debate. T.P. Carney (http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/author/timothy-p.-carney) and Ben Domenech (http://thefederalist.com/author/bdomenech/) argued that Donald Trump is the natural result of a Republican party elite that perennially promises working-class whites the world and is shocked when those people stop trusting the party elites. On the other side, Jennifer Rubin (https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jennifer-rubin) and Bret Stephens (http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/bret-stephens/5463) argued that the Trump voters themselves are to blame.</p></div>
<div><strong>Are 'Elites' to Blame for the Rise of Donald Trump?</strong> <small>2016-09-14 18:02:29</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Who is at fault for the Donald Trump phenomenon? An audience of New York elites attended a debate on Tuesday night in Manhattan and ultimately delivered a surprising verdict.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens began his opening argument at the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. (http://opentodebate.org) event by noting that those sitting in the crowd at the Kaufman Center on Manhattan's Upper West Side are themselves the so-called elites. How many had traveled to Europe in the last five years? How many had graduate degrees? How many knew whether Sancerre was red or white wine?</p>
<p>As the majority of the audience raised their hands, he said, "I hate to break it to you, but you are the elite."</p></div>
<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer. As we now know, the inspector general of the State Department did not find she had violated any criminal laws and FBI Director James Comey – no Hillary Clinton fan – agreed that not one of the 33,000 emails she transferred to her private server contained recognizable classified markings.</p>
<p>But that example cuts both ways. Yes, it is obviously hypocritical for Trump and his supporters to scream about due process in the Colorado case. But Mrs. Clinton’s example also shows why due process is so important. She was never convicted of anything. And, so far at least, neither has Trump.</p>
<p>Winning a criminal insurrection conspiracy case won’t be a cakewalk for Special Counsel Jack Smith. I say this because on Dec. 14 I participated as playing Smith’s role as “prosecutor” in a mock trial sponsored by the nationally respected nonprofit organization Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/). Our mock argument was live-streamed last week, but it can be heard again on Jan. 5, 2024, the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection effort, on an NPR local affiliate; seen and heard on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AQxFtqh-4); on opentodebate.org; or on available podcast channels.</p>
<p>During this mock trial, the Trump side was represented by Sara Azari (https://www.azarilaw.com/sara-azari), a Los Angeles-based defense lawyer. Sara argued not only the absence of a smoking gun admission or written evidence by Trump that he knew he had lost the election; she also effectively argued that Trump’s claims, though false, are protected as political speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>My response was that the First Amendment does not protect lies that are part of a criminal conspiracy. I pointed out that there will be testimony from several people that Trump admitted he had lost but lied about it. However, I also pointed out that a jury can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the voter fraud did not cost him the election because the highest officials of his government, whom he appointed, all told him he had lost, including the attorney general, senior Justice Department officials, the director of national intelligence, and every single state official in the key battleground states whom he called. Georgia’s secretary of state of told him he had lost after three separate recounts. Still Trump asked him to “find” one vote more than the total Biden was found to have won Georgia – proving he knew he was asking the secretary of state to lie.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that 61 out of 61 state court judges rejected his claim that he had lost these key battleground states because of voter fraud. (Once in Pennsylvania, a court found some voter fraud, but that judge also ruled it wasn’t significant enough to change the outcome in that state).</p>
<p>In any event, there will and must be a test of Donald Trump’s culpability, but that must come in a trial, with due process by a finder of fact that reaches a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. America cannot accept a verdict barring Trump from running for office based on a court hearing 1,500 miles from Washington, D.C., without a trial, on a civil court standard of “preponderance of the evidence” – meaning anything above 50%.</p>
<p>Those of us who oppose Trump can beat him at the ballot box, especially if and when he is convicted of felonies in one or more of the criminal trials he faces in federal and state courts. Colorado’s chief justice was right in his dissent when he concluded Trump should not be barred by a state court “in the absence of an insurrection-related conviction” – the latter word meaning after a trial and a jury of his peers finds the defendant guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Lanny Davis is the founder of the Washington, D.C., law firm, Lanny J. Davis & Associates. He is one of the first to use the concept of legal crisis management to solve client problems – operating at the intersection of law, media, and politics. He is a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton in 1996-98 and served on a privacy and civil liberties panel appointed by President George W. Bush. He has been writing his “Purple Nation” column for more than 13 years.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> September 07, 2016</p>
<p>Reducing carbon emissions is clearly good for the environment but often imposes substantial costs.  The costs are most obvious when coal companies go bankrupt, but can affect everyone indirectly through higher energy costs, slower economic growth, reduced employment, and lower business profits.   Has the Environmental Protection Agency considered the costs and benefits of its regulatory mandates fairly and appropriately? Is its Clean Power Plan a bold initiative to reduce carbon pollution at power plants, or an unconstitutional usurpation of power?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Carl Pope, Sierra Club's former director, counters the economic harm argument by saying the number of coal plants retired under the EPA's previous air pollution rules are driving cleaner sources of electricity, with very little harm to the economy.</p>
<p>The country is already moving away from coal, and the Clean Power Plan follows that trend line. This argument helped him win an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Oxford-style debate this month on the Clean Power Plan, and the legal challenges against it.</p>
<p>The motion for debate was "Climate Change: The EPA Has Gone Overboard." It was held live at George Washington University and webcast. Online and live polling were done before and after the debate. Before the debate, 59 percent were against the motion that the EPA had gone overboard. By the end of the debate, 72 percent were against the motion.</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Carl Pope, Sierra Club's former director, counters the economic harm argument by saying the number of coal plants retired under the EPA's previous air pollution rules are driving cleaner sources of electricity, with very little harm to the economy.</p>
<p>The country is already moving away from coal, and the Clean Power Plan follows that trend line. This argument helped him win an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Oxford-style debate this month on the Clean Power Plan, and the legal challenges against it.</p>
<p>The motion for debate was "Climate Change: The EPA Has Gone Overboard." It was held live at George Washington University and webcast. Online and live polling were done before and after the debate. Before the debate, 59 percent were against the motion that the EPA had gone overboard. By the end of the debate, 72 percent were against the motion.</p>
<p>Those for the motion stood at 18 percent before the debate, and 23 percent in post-debate live and online electronic polling.</p></div>

<p>The Constitution provides that "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States," and it goes on to grant Congress a robust-and fearsome-list of powers. James Madison assumed that "[i]n republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates," and he cautioned that the legislative department may tend to "draw[] all power into its impetuous vortex." But modern politics and law seem to tell a quite different story. With executive orders, administrative regulations, creative interpretations of federal statutes, and executive agreements with other nations, it may seem that the President, not Congress, is, in effect, wielding the most potent legislative power. Indeed, the Supreme Court is currently poised to decide whether President Obama's unilateral immigration actions usurped Congress's power and flouted his duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." But some argue that this is nothing new: they say that the President is not exercising legislative power; he is simply exercising his well-established executive discretion. Is Congress still the most powerful branch, or is this the era of the imperial presidency? Has the President usurped Congress's legislative power?</p>

<p>In 2014, a permit to hunt a single endangered black rhino was sold for $350,000… as part of a program to support its conservation in Namibia. Counterintuitive? Through funds raised from legal hunting—the purchase of permits in Africa, licenses and taxes here in the U.S.—, hunters contribute significantly to wildlife conservation efforts. Hunting has also become an important tool in the effort to control animal populations, to the benefit of humans and wildlife alike. But are big-game revenues really benefiting conservation and local communities? And is hunting a humane way to maintain equilibrium and habitats, or are there better alternatives?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Last May, a group called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. sponsored a debate on whether to ban college football. A portion of the discussion concerned the nature of our social contract with higher education and by extension college sports.

<div class='news-content'><p>On Wednesday night, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. held an enlightening debate on genetically modified foods on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (video here). As anyone with a web browser knows, companies like Monsanto are now routinely portrayed in the media (especially social media) as the epitome of corporate evil. The idea is that GMO companies are remorselessly destroying the earth and poisoning mankind with Frankenstein foods in order to line the pockets of their one-percenter CEOs. Well, a fascinating thing happened very early in the debate that shed light on all this. Charles Benbrook, a research professor at the Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources was asked about the scientific consensus, developed over 20 years, on the health impact of genetically modified food. Here's his response...</p></div>

<p>In 2014, a permit to hunt a single endangered black rhino was sold for $350,000… as part of a program to support its conservation in Namibia. Counterintuitive? Through funds raised from legal hunting—the purchase of permits in Africa, licenses and taxes here in the U.S.—, hunters contribute significantly to wildlife conservation efforts. Hunting has also become an important tool in the effort to control animal populations, to the benefit of humans and wildlife alike. But are big-game revenues really benefiting conservation and local communities? And is hunting a humane way to maintain equilibrium and habitats, or are there better alternatives?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Last May, a group called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. sponsored a debate on whether to ban college football. A portion of the discussion concerned the nature of our social contract with higher education and by extension college sports.

<div class='news-content'><p>On Wednesday night, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. held an enlightening debate on genetically modified foods on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (video here). As anyone with a web browser knows, companies like Monsanto are now routinely portrayed in the media (especially social media) as the epitome of corporate evil. The idea is that GMO companies are remorselessly destroying the earth and poisoning mankind with Frankenstein foods in order to line the pockets of their one-percenter CEOs. Well, a fascinating thing happened very early in the debate that shed light on all this. Charles Benbrook, a research professor at the Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources was asked about the scientific consensus, developed over 20 years, on the health impact of genetically modified food. Here's his response...</p></div>

<p>The auto industry, agriculture, the energy sector. What do they have in common? These industries benefit from government subsidies in the form of loans, tax breaks, regulation, and other preferences. Critics from the left and right say that not only do these subsidies transfer wealth from taxpayers to corporations, they distort the markets and our economy. Proponents say that government has an important role to play in launching innovation via strategic investment, and its support helps American companies thrive. Do we need subsidies, or is this corporate welfare?</p>

<p><strong>Jack Abramoff</strong><br>Jack Abramoff is arguably one of the world's most famous lobbyists and former Washington power players. Dubbed on the cover of Time as the 'Man Who Bought Washington', Abramoff rose to become the nation's most successful and prominent lobbyist before becoming enmeshed in the most harrowing political scandal since Watergate, for which he served 43 months in federal prison. Few know more about how Washington really works. Abramoff commenced his political career in college, when he was elected national chairman of the College Republicans. He next headed President Reagan's grassroots lobbying organization, honing the skills he would later deploy to become the nation's top legislative advocate. Beginning in 1994, Abramoff built one of the most prestigious and profitable lobbying practices before his name became synonymous with corruption and what's wrong with our government. The fall from grace woke him up. Now, he's determined to rectify his wrongs and reform our corrupt political system.</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Quantitative easing has been good for Wall Street, but has it done anything for the average American? It's debatable.</p>
<p>At an event this week in New York hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that holds Oxford-style debates on important issues, two teams of two duked it out over this question: Can central banks print prosperity?</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>While most agree that the U.S. narrowly avoided a second Great Depression, how that happened isn't agreed upon. In fact, whether QE works at all is an open question, one that will be debated tonight in New York.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that seeks to foster constructive, reasonable analysis in public discourse through a series of Oxford-style debates, will host its latest debate on Wednesday, focusing on the following motion: Can central banks print prosperity? In the words of John Donvan, Intelligence Squared U.S.'s long-time debate moderator, four supremely qualified debaters will argue for and against the motion: Simon Johnson a professor and MIT and former chief economist and the IMF (for) Roger Bootle, executive chairman of economic research firm Capital Economics (for) Edward Conard, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a former partner at Bain Capital (against); and Andrew Huszar, a senior fellow at Rutgers Business School (against).</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>A major debate between leading U.S. experts on refugee and migration issues, organized by the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. organization, produced drastically split results on the motion of whether the U.S. should let in 100,000 Syrian Refugees.</p></div>
<div><strong>A Humanitarian Stimulus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>It's time to dispose of the politics of fear and embrace a pro-refugee, pro-economy policy.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The new Middle East refugees appear to fit this pattern. In a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. on refugees, David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, noted that eight out of 10 Syrian refugees to the United States are employed within six months of admission. And the Office of Refugee Resettlement within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported in 2013 that Iraqi refugees rapidly increased their rate of economic self-sufficiency from their initial arrival in the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Speakers For:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jack Abramoff</strong><br>Jack Abramoff is arguably one of the world's most famous lobbyists and former Washington power players. Dubbed on the cover of Time as the 'Man Who Bought Washington', Abramoff rose to become the nation's most successful and prominent lobbyist before becoming enmeshed in the most harrowing political scandal since Watergate, for which he served 43 months in federal prison. Few know more about how Washington really works. Abramoff commenced his political career in college, when he was elected national chairman of the College Republicans. He next headed President Reagan's grassroots lobbying organization, honing the skills he would later deploy to become the nation's top legislative advocate. Beginning in 1994, Abramoff built one of the most prestigious and profitable lobbying practices before his name became synonymous with corruption and what's wrong with our government. The fall from grace woke him up. Now, he's determined to rectify his wrongs and reform our corrupt political system.</p>

<div><strong>Why Income Inequality Is America's Biggest (and Most Difficult) Problem</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>But, here's the problem: The same political forces that allowed the 1 percent to take our political system hostage have only worsened in the past decade. As Nick Hanauer notes in a recent Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, "At the same time, the percent of labor the percent of GDP devoted to labor has gone from 52 to 42. So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually. So here's the thing you have to understand. That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be. It's profit because powerful people like me and [Edward Conrad] prefer it to be. That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages. Or on discounts for consumers. This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics. This is a consequence of differentials in power."</p></div>

<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<div><strong>The Fatal Conceit of the 'Right to be Forgotten'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a lively debate last week over the so-called 'Right to be Forgotten 'embraced by European courts'which, as tech executive Andrew McLaughlin aptly noted, would be more honestly described as a 'right to force others to forget.' A primary consequence of this 'right' thus far has been that citizens are entitled to demand that search engines like Google censor the results that are returned for a search on the person's name, provided those results are 'inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.' In other words, if you're unhappy that an unflattering item' such as a news story'shows up as a prominent result for your name, you can declare it 'irrelevant' even if entirely truthful and ask Google to stop showing it as a result for such searches, with ultimate recourse to the courts if the company refuses. Within two months of the ruling establishing the 'right,' the company received more than 70,000 such requests.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Science, Tech</p>
<p>As technology rapidly progresses, some proponents of artificial intelligence believe that it will help solve complex social challenges and offer immortality via virtual humans. But AI’s critics are sounding the alarm, going so far as to call its development an “existential threat” to mankind. Is this the stuff of science fiction? Could the “Terminator” become reality, or will these fears prevent the next technological revolution?</p>

Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views.

<div class='news-content'><p>I recently attended an Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate over whether 'smart technology is making us dumb.' Those who argued that it was said we're too distracted by our phones to think long and hard about serious issues, and also because something something selfies. But the Pew study finds that between the selfies, Millennials are actually reading more serious news that challenges their point of view. Millennials report seeing more political news posts on Facebook than older generations, and they're more likely to report seeing posts that do not support their views. Only 18 percent of Millennials say they always or most of the time see posts that support their politics.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education</p>
<p>Protests have erupted on university campuses across the country. To many, these students are speaking out against racial injustice that has long been manifested in unwelcoming, sometimes hostile environments. But to critics, their demands have gone too far, creating an atmosphere of intolerance for opposing or unpopular points of view. Are the protestors silencing free speech, or are they just trying to be heard? And are the universities responding by defending free speech, or by suppressing it?</p>

<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus.

The debate concerned higher education generally, not just the host institution.

<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>

<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the issue will land in the spotlight at the Yale Repertory Theatre as four debaters argue for or against the statement, Free speech is threatened on campus.</p>
<p>I don't think there's any question that free speech is threatened on campus. I think the question is whether free speech should be threatened on campus, said Wendy Kaminer, who is one of the debaters in the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, sponsored by the Adam Smith Society, an organization composed of business school students and alumni.</p></div>
<div><strong>Tell Us: Is Your Speech Policed in Your Dorm?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On Tuesday, an audience gathered at Yale to hear a debate on the proposition, 'Free speech is threatened on campus.'The question pertained to institutions of higher education generally, not just the host university. The outcome: a clear majority agree that free speech is threatened. But that wasn't yet true when the event began.</p></div>
<div><strong>Students Unswayed by Free Speech Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Before a nearly full auditorium at the Yale Repertory Theater Tuesday night, the NPR show 'Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate'hosted a debate on the motion that free speech is threatened on college campuses. But despite the robust turnout, most students' opinions on the topic remained largely unchanged, with students stating that many of the arguments advanced at the debate were ideas they had already heard last fall.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>The atmosphere on college campuses has changed, a Columbia University professor argued before an audience full of Yale students and New Haven residents Tuesday. And that change has created spaces in which free speech is not extinguished, but threatened.</p>
<p>A majority of the audience agreed.</p>
<p>After a debate hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a nonprofit that provides free online access to debates held across the country on issues facing society, 66 percent of the audience left convinced that free speech is threatened on college campuses. The event was held at the Yale Repertory Theatre.</p></div>

<div><strong>The Glaring Evidence That Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate at Yale highlighted the disconnect between those who would downplay the problem, and the growing mass of evidence that they're wrong.</p>
<p>At a recentIntelligence Squared / Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/free-speech-threatened-campus/), an audience filled an auditorium at Yale University to weigh the timely proposition, 'Free speech is threatened on campus.' The debate concerned higher education generally, not just the host institution. And at the event's conclusion, having heard arguments on both sides of the question, 66 percent of the crowd agreed: free speech is threatened. That represented a 17-point shift from a poll taken as the event began. The evidence is that persuasive.</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate: Free Speech Is Threatened on Campus</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate presented an excellent debate on Tuesday at Yale 'Resolved: Free speech is threatened on campus.'</p>
<p>Yale was a particularly apt venue for this debate. Yale has a proud tradition of freedom of speech, and its official statement on free speech, the 'Woodward Report' of 1974, is one of the strongest defenses of free speech in the academy. But the infamous controversy of this past Halloween, and the way that Yale handled the controversy, have led many to doubt Yale's current commitment to free speech. This year, Yale only narrowly avoided ranking among the 10 worst colleges in the United States for free speech, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). So this debate was particularly timely, and it clearly struck a nerve at Yale.</p></div>
<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Health, Science</p>
<p>What if we didn’t have to grow old and die? The average American can expect to live for 78.8 years, an improvement over the days before clean water and vaccines, when life expectancy was closer to 50, but still not long enough for most of us. So researchers around the world have been working on arresting the process of aging through biotechnology and finding cures to diseases like Alzheimer’s and cancer. What are the ethical and social consequences of radically increasing lifespans? Should we accept a “natural” end, or should we find a cure to aging?</p>

<p>The debate, hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. and FIRE, was an engaging conversation about the existing and potential role of these drugs in society, and in particular on college campuses.</p></div>
<div><strong>Why Banning Smart Drugs for College Students Is Impossible, Evil</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Should college students be allowed to take Adderall and Modafinil to improve their academic performance, or should universities treat these so-called smart drugs the same way Major League Baseball treats steroids? I attended a debate on the subject at George Washington University last night and came away convinced that banning smart drugs is not only impractical it's profoundly evil.</p></div>
<div><strong>"Smart Drugs" Are Here -Should College Students Be Allowed to Use Them?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:45:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>We use coffee to stay awake, good food and nutrition to stay healthy and alert. But if there was a drug that made you smarter, helped you learn, and made you more focused, would you take it?</p>
<p>That's a question that Nicole Vincent, associate professor of philosophy, law and neuroscience at Georgia State University, asked to open her TED talk in Sydney last year.</p>
<p>That question also opened a Monday night debate at George Washington University in which two sides argued both for and against whether "College Students Should Be Allowed to Take Smart Drugs."</p></div>

<p>This question was the subject of debate among experts at the Jack Morton Auditorium Monday night.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S., World</p>
<p>Since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011, more than 4 million Syrians have fled the country, creating the greatest refugee crisis since World War II. Most have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, but many have risked death to reach Europe and the possibility of a better life. Unlike Europe and Syria’s neighbors, the United States has had the advantage of picking and choosing from afar, taking in just over 2,000 Syrian refugees since the war’s start. The Obama administration has pledged to take another 10,000 in 2016, but there are some who suggest that we are falling well below the number that we can and should accept. What are our moral obligations, and what are the cultural, economic, and security issues that must be taken into account? Should the U.S. let in 100,000 Syrian refugees?</p>

<p><strong>Speakers For:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Ford</strong><br>Robert S. Ford is currently a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, where he writes about developments in the Levant and North Africa. From 2011 to 2014, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to Syria, after which he retired from the U.S. Foreign Service. In this role, he was the State Department's lead on Syria, proposing and implementing policy and developing common strategies with European and Middle Eastern allies to try to resolve the Syrian conflict. Prior to this, he was Deputy U.S. Ambassador to Iraq (2008–2010); U.S. Ambassador to Algeria (2006–2008); Deputy Chief of Mission in Bahrain (2001–2004); and Political Counselor to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad (2004–2006), during the tumultuous establishment of the new, permanent Iraqi government. Ford received the Secretary's Service Award, the U.S. State Department's highest honor, in 2014 and the John F.

<div class='news-content'><p>A recent debate, Embrace the Common Core? hosted by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., featured some of the nation's top experts on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The Oxford-style 2 vs. 2 debate show included comments on topics such as whether or not the CCSS is actually right for kids and the rationale behind national standards. In particular, the debate focused on the controversial CCSS-aligned assessments and the cognitive appropriateness of the standards. The debate offered a refreshing take on what is often a politically charged topic. Many other educational bloggers have also offered analysis of this debate, including Diane Ravitch and The Washington Post's Valerie Strauss.</p></div>

<div><strong>Andrew Solomon on Assisted Suicide, Brittany Maynard and Death with Dignity</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The end of a life is inevitably tragic but what if an even bigger tragedy could be avoided by hastening it?</p>
<p>That was the eventuality that 29-year-old Brittany Maynard chose to avoid. On Nov. 1, supported by her family and the millions around the world who learned about her choice to end her life before an aggressive brain tumor could leech it from her slowly and painfully, Maynard took a prescribed dose of lethal medication.</p>
<p>To get that prescription, Maynard moved with her family to Oregon, one of only five states with a Death with Dignity law that allows for assisted suicide, in which a doctor can provide medication to end the life of a dying patient who's deemed mentally competent. Whether the option should be available nationwide, or banned entirely, will be the subject of an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate taking place Nov. 13, with passionate advocates on both sides.</p></div>
<div><strong>Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate: Legalize Assisted Suicide?</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Two weeks after the physician-assisted suicide of 29-year-old Brittany Maynard, an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate in New York explored whether the policy is compatible with the doctor's healing role. The argument opposing physician-assisted suicide laws was judged the winning one by an audience gathered at the Kaufman Music Center Thursday night.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Social Implications of Brittany Maynard 'Dying With Dignity'</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>During an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. panel in New York City Wednesday evening, debaters argued over what defines dignity and what it means, exactly to die with it. Dying with dignity, in Brittany Maynard's mind, implies that taking control of her situation and dying on her own terms is the best possible solution to her diagnosis. Having control over your own death may not be natural per se, but it can be compassionate. Maynard made the choice because life was the way she wanted to experience it should have been full of youth, vigor, beauty, and love, not pain, suffering, and a gradual wasting away of her mind and body. But to the physicians arguing against the law, dignity meant embracing the fact that life's value wasn't only found in beauty, youth, and independence things our society values so much. Life itself was dignity, they claimed, even if it meant becoming deteriorated, old, and dependent.</p></div>

<p>Are America's best days behind it? Or should the world continue to bet on its future as a global superpower?</p>
<p>That was the subject of a spirited, four-person debate this week in New York City at the Kaufman Music Center, the 100th in a series called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Over the past decade, the debate event, sponsored by the public policy and education organization Rosenkranz Foundation, has featured a variety of experts weighing in on pressing topics of the day, such as the U.S.'s Middle East policy, genetically modified food, and the ethics of fracking, among other things.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>

<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>

Having control over your own death may not be natural per se, but it can be compassionate. Maynard made the choice because life was the way she wanted to experience it should have been full of youth, vigor, beauty, and love, not pain, suffering, and a gradual wasting away of her mind and body. But to the physicians arguing against the law, dignity meant embracing the fact that life's value wasn't only found in beauty, youth, and independence things our society values so much. Life itself was dignity, they claimed, even if it meant becoming deteriorated, old, and dependent.</p></div>

<div><strong>In a Debate About the American Future, America Wins</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Immigration and innovation will enable America to maintain its position as a superpower, experts say, despite policy mistakes made along the way.</p>
<p>Are America's best days behind it? Or should the world continue to bet on its future as a global superpower?</p>
<p>That was the subject of a spirited, four-person debate this week in New York City at the Kaufman Music Center, the 100th in a series called Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. Over the past decade, the debate event, sponsored by the public policy and education organization Rosenkranz Foundation, has featured a variety of experts weighing in on pressing topics of the day, such as the U.S.'s Middle East policy, genetically modified food, and the ethics of fracking, among other things.</p></div>
<div><strong>Experts Debate Whether 'Right to Be Forgotten' Should Be Adopted in the U.S.</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The 'right to be forgotten' should be adopted in the U.S. because Americans deserve the ability to exercise control over their personal data. Then again, the right to be forgotten could be seen as a form of censorship that aims to conceal past news. At least that's what four privacy and technology experts debated Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The experts considered whether the ruling should be (hypothetically) implemented in the U.S. Organized by Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. , a live New York City audience served as the barometer for which side won the debate. Before any words were exchanged, 36 percent believed the U.S. should adopt the ruling; 26 percent were against it, and 38 percent were undecided.</p></div>
<div><strong>The Right to Be Forgotten from Google? Forget It, Says U.S. Crowd</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The University of Oklahoma expelled two fraternity members this week after video of them leading a racist chant went viral. Now, a Google search of the young men's names shows the incident right at the top of the results.</p>
<p>But should this still be the case in 30 years? Should future employers and girlfriends be able to use Google to easily discover the video? Or would it be better for the U.S. to create a law to allow such men, one day in the future, to cloak their youthful misdeeds?</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the Kaufman Center in New York City, the Oklahoma frat brothers were discussed as part of a larger debate over whether it's time for the U.S. to adopt a 'right to be forgotten' law to help people hide their past.</p></div>
<div><strong>Arguments Against Death Penalty Abolition Prevail in Great Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate</strong> <small>2016-05-13 14:21:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I have long been a fan of the Intelligence Squared U.S. / Open to Debate series, which I often hear on my local NPR station (and which too often leads me to stay in my car longer than I had intended). I was especially excited when I learned that the series was finally going to focus on the death penalty.</p></div>
