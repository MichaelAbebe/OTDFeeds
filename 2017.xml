<p>Do conservative or liberal philosophies lead to more just outcomes? Opposing moral philosophies have long fueled debate about America’s policy goals and national identity. For conservatives, morality is grounded in ideals such as patriotism, including a respect for order and authority; fairness and liberty in the sense that an individual’s actions yield just rewards, or consequences; and reverence for the sanctity of religious and moral tradition. Liberals place moral emphasis on caring: for the poor, the disadvantaged, and the marginalized; on fairness in the sense of redressing both historic wrongs and current inequalities of outcome; and on generosity extending beyond the bounds of nations or cultures. In today’s divisive political arena, which side best embodies the nation’s most cherished virtues? Morally speaking, is the left right?</p>

<div><strong>How Howard Dean Debates Liberal Moral Superiority With David Brooks</strong> <small>2017-12-11 17:28:09</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In the Trump era, tribalism bests morality. The party of Lincoln elected a reality television star who recently endorsed a senate candidate accused of molesting teenagers. Meanwhile, two Democratic leaders resigned this week after dozens of sexual assault allegations. Conservatism’s underlining principles of economic empowerment have fallen to deep state conspiracy, while liberalism’s social egalitarianism is subverted into media soundbites. As both parties reconcile their roles amid a political landscape upended by populism and global networks, liberalism (long touted as the voice of reason) faces an existential crisis over whether its morals can withstand an inherently immoral climate.

<p>College sports is a big-money business, with football and basketball programs generating millions of dollars in revenue every year. While coaches and athletic directors in Division I programs routinely score seven-figure contracts, student-athletes are currently prohibited from sharing in the profits. Is it time to rewrite the rules in college sports and allow athletes their fair share of the profits? Or would providing monetary incentives -- above and beyond existing scholarships and career supports -- spoil the sport?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><em>This debate was presented live at Transform, the annual conference of the Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation</em>
The United States spends more on health care than any other nation, but the system remains woefully inefficient. Consumers are fed up with soaring costs and poor outcomes, insurers take issue with market instability, and providers lament rising barriers to quality care. And while government is forced to contend with enormous financial strain, employers fear that rising health care costs will impact wages and sap their competitive advantage. Have the structural shortcomings of America’s fragmented system put us on the road to total system failure? Do we need to design tomorrow’s health care on a clean slate, or can innovations to the existing health care framework jolt the system back to life?</p>

<p>Against the backdrop of North Korea's nuclear advances and escalating regional tensions, we ask: How should the U.S. respond to its most urgent national security threats?
In a wide-ranging evening of debate, <strong>General David Petraeus</strong> joins military historian <strong>Max Boot</strong> for a keynote conversation and broad look into the most pressing global challenges of the Trump era. Once the stage is set, four of the world's most prominent foreign policy voices will zero in on the most important strategic relationship of the twenty-first century: the United States and China. Staged with our new <strong>"Unresolved" </strong>debate format, these debaters will argue for or against a number of motions including: Is Donald Trump making China great again? Is China destined for regional dominance?  And can we strike a deal with Beijing to contain North Korea’s nuclear program?</p>

<div><strong>'You can't drone your way out of a problem': David Petraeus shares 5 key lessons from 15 years of fighting terrorism</strong> <small>2017-09-15 17:06:26</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Retired General David Petraeus shared lessons learned from over fifteen years of combatting terrorists and extremists in the Middle East and Afghanistan at a forum Wednesday. The takeaway: even with all the US military's capabilities, you can't "drone strike your way out of a problem." Speaking at the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate at New York University with the Council on Foreign Relations' Max Boot, Petraeus who commanded US and NATO troops in Afghanistan and served as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency under former President Barack Obama discussed what he views as the five lessons the US should have learned from combatting Islamic extremism.</p></div>
<div><strong>Up for debate: Would doing less in Ukraine help US prepare for China challenge?</strong> <small>2023-02-23 17:18:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA HAWKS SEEK SHIFT AWAY FROM UKRAINE: Just as Ukraine is facing a critical inflection point in what the Pentagon sees as a small window to break through Russian lines and reclaim the momentum in the yearlong war, there are Republicans in Congress who argue now is the time for the U.S. to scale back its support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Among those advocating a turn away from Ukraine is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is scheduled to deliver an address today at the Heritage Foundation, in which he will advocate a defense policy that prioritizes China as America’s biggest threat and “challenges the consensus on Ukraine.” The speech will focus on “key decisions America must make to deter China – including doing less in Ukraine,” according to a press release from his office.</p>
<p>“I want the Europeans on the continent there to do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Hawley told (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQNa2lHyAb0&t=78s) St. Louis television station KSDK last week. “Obviously I want to see Russia defeated …There's no doubt about any of that.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what are America's interests in the midst of this? Is our interest in nation-building in Ukraine? And by that I mean writing checks directly to the Ukrainian government,” Hawley said. “That's what we're doing and have been doing for months. What we should be doing is saying to the Europeans, Germany at the front of the list, you need to take the first priority, the lead in defending Ukraine and standing up to Russia. We will prioritize China.”</p>
<p>NATO DISCUSSES MAJOR INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING ACROSS ALLIANCE (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/defense-national-security/nato-major-increase-defense-spending)</p>
<p>THE ‘UKRAINE FATIGUE’ RESOLUTION: Hawley is in the minority in his party, but he’s not alone. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a resolution that would express to the House that it’s time to cut off U.S. assistance to Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,” the symbolic bill has no chance of enactment, but it did attract 10 hard-right cosponsors: Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Mary Miller (R-IL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).</p>
<p>The complaints about the high cost of U.S. aid come as a survey (https://apnorc.org/projects/acontinuing-support-for-u-s-involvement-a-year-into-the-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-a/) conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that while Americans still think the U.S. should play “at least some role in the war,” support for specific interventions like supplying weapons is “waning.”</p>
<p>MCCAUL: ‘THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE’: The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says many who are wavering on funding for Ukraine are concerned about how the money is being spent.</p>
<p>“You've got people in the fringe elements on both sides that are just dug in. You have a lot of people in the middle on my side of the aisle who are just being a little bit quiet to see how the winds blow because their big question is, ‘I just want to know where the money's gone,’” Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX) said in an interview with the Washington Examiner to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If I can explain that to them, and explain the accountability and the audits taking place … and then bring the Trump national security team in to say that this is the right foreign policy. I think those combined would go a long ways,” McCaul said. “What I want to do is basically be able to tell the story of where the money has gone. A third of it's gone into replenishing our stockpile and modernizing our weapon systems, a third is going to our defense contractors to make new weapons, which we really need, and then a third's going into Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“I mean, with less than 3% of our Department of Defense budget, they've annihilated the Russian military, they've humiliated them,” McCaul added. “Without one American soldier, which is key.”</p>

<p>Do you have a secret that no one else knows?  What about Apple, Google, Facebook, Verizon, or Uber?  Are you sure they don’t know your secret?  Digital data – emails, text messages, phone records, location records, web searches – contain traces of almost every secret.  They also contain traces of almost every crime.  Tech companies may promise to protect our data from prying eyes.  But should that promise yield to law enforcement and national security?

Digital data – emails, text messages, phone records, location records, web searches – contain traces of almost every secret.  They also contain traces of almost every crime.  Tech companies may promise to protect our data from prying eyes.  But should that promise yield to law enforcement and national security?

<p>As video games gain prominence, some game creators are turning to global issues, such as poverty alleviation, international diplomacy, and combating climate change, for inspiration. Playing these socially minded games, they argue, allows users to build tangible skills in combating crisis and solving critical problems. But others see the multibillion-dollar gaming industry, dominated by portrayals of crime and war, as a threat that desensitizes its users to violence and encourages anti-social behavior.  Will video games soon provide innovative solutions to our most pressing social, political and economic challenges?  Or is the impact of gaming overrated and potentially destructive?</p>

<p><strong>Five Debaters. Four Debates. Trump's First 100 Days.</strong>
The first 100 days of the Trump administration have been filled with a whirlwind of new policies and challenges to Washington orthodoxies, and the country is sharply divided.  But if we are open to it, we might find that there are reasonable arguments being made by both sides on many issues.  And those conversations can start by considering: President Trump’s “America First” policy, and what it means to different people; the administration’s impact on the health of the stock market and our economy; the team that the president has assembled; and whether it’s the media, or the president, that’s under attack. In one night we embark on a radical departure from our Oxford-style format, asking five debaters, from across the political spectrum, for their views on four key issues under the new Trump presidency.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>Walmart has long been a target for critics of corporate expansion, but does the company really deserve the scrutiny?  Some say that the big-box retailer devastates small communities by pushing out locally-owned businesses, mistreats its workers through low pay and restrictive work hours, and forces American companies  to use cheap foreign labor to produce goods at low cost.  Others point to the fact that Walmart provides countless jobs to low-skilled American workers, sells affordable goods, has increasingly become a leader in sustainability, and attracts new consumers and businesses to its neighborhoods.  Has Walmart been good for America?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>If budget-cutters in Washington decided to eliminate food-stamp benefits to New Yorkers, the city’s politicians would be denouncing the cruelty of the “Republican war on the poor.” Yet Mayor Bill De Blasio and the city council are already inflicting the same sort of pain on low-income New Yorkers by denying them access to one of the nation’s most effective anti-poverty programs: Walmart.</p>
<p>When he was mayor, Michael Bloomberg supported Walmart’s efforts to open a store in New York, but the company faced unremitting resistance from unions and elected officials, and it gave up the fight once de Blasio moved into Gracie Mansion. “I have been adamant that I don’t think Walmart the company, the stores belong in New York City,” de Blasio said.</p></div>

<p>But for many of Walmart’s workers, the company illuminates the darker side of capitalism: The company does nearly $500 billion in worldwide sales each year, but its low prices are made possible by cheap, overseas production and hourly workers’ paltry pay. Walmart is the largest private employer in the U.S. About 1.5 million Americans work for the company, which is equivalent to roughly 1 percent of the U.S. workforce.

<p>Imagine getting a check from the government every month.  $600 guaranteed.  It’s happening in Finland, where a pilot program is being launched to test what’s known as a “universal basic income.” As technology transforms the workplace, jobs and income will become less reliable. The idea is that a universal basic income could serve as a tool to combat poverty and uncertainty in a changing society, and provide a cushion that empowers workers, giving them latitude to take risks in the job market. But some argue a guaranteed income would take away the incentive to work, waste money on those who don’t need it, and come at the expense of effective programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Is the universal basic income the safety net of the future?</p>

<div><strong>Guess Which Side Obama Alums Took in a Debate Over Basic Income</strong> <small>2017-03-29 21:22:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Should all Americans be given a guaranteed basic income, just enough money that any person could scrape by on their monthly check from the government? New York City’s Upper West Side gave the idea a very firm no-vote last week.</p>
<p>“The universal basic income is supported across the political ideologies because it’s a fix efficient and flexible and humane and can end poverty once and for all,” former union chief Andy Stern said of the idea, but his case fell largely on deaf ears in the end.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea of a universal basic income has been taking up a lot more cultural space lately. Elite startup accelerator Y Combinator has been cooking up an experiment to test how cash without conditions compared to prescriptive help (such as support specifically for housing, job training, or child-rearing). The non-profit GiveDirectly is testing the same question, but in the developing world, which Annie Lowrey took a close look at for The New York Times Magazine. Wired even ran a science fiction story about a world in which everyone had a guaranteed income, called “The Hunger After You’re Fed.”</p>
<p>In technology circles, increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence will mean that there won’t be enough jobs out there for people. First, they will come for truck drivers, but eventually, they’ll take out writers, too. On the positive side, one could also argue that a basic income could open opportunities for entrepreneurship to strata of society too financially stressed to consider starting something today.</p></div>
<div><strong>Universal basic income debate sharpens as observers grasp for solutions to inequality</strong> <small>2017-03-27 16:20:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Is a guaranteed paycheck from the government, with no strings attached, the answer to the relentless rise of automation?</p>
<p>The concept might sound far-fetched, but a so-called universal basic income (UBI), is currently one of the most hotly debated policy topics being floated as a means to address income inequality and the disruption that technology poses to the workforce. UBI is being tested in Finland and other international markets, but has received decidedly mixed reactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, developments in robotics and artificial intelligence have grave implications for the labor force. A report issued this week from consulting firm PwC found that more than a third of U.S. jobs were at risk from automation, upping the ante for policy makers to cushion the blow to workers.</p>
<p>Advocates for UBI argue that a guaranteed paycheck could serve as a way to fight poverty and uncertainty in an evolving U.S. economy and encourage workers to take more risks in the job market if they had some extra money as a cushion.</p>
<p>The idea has gained prominent backers such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently told CNBC he supported UBI joining a growing list of tech execs who've voiced support for the concept as a solution to unemployment that will be caused by future automation and the rise of the robots. Silicon Valley's Y Combinator President Sam Altman and eBay Founder Pierre Omidyar have also expressed support for a universal income.</p></div>
<div><strong>Watch Live: Will Universal Basic Income Change Our Lives for Good or Bad?</strong> <small>2017-03-23 22:06:43</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Each year, robots and artificially intelligence systems cause unemployment rates to increase as more and more jobs become automated. And when you stop to take a look, the numbers are harrowing.</p>
<p>In Canada, a study conducted by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship found that a staggering 40 percent of Canadian jobs will be taken over by machines in the next few decades. In the United Kingdom, a study conducted by Oxford University and Deloitte, a business advisory firm, found that 850,000 public sector jobs in the region will likely be lost by 2030. In Southeast Asia, an estimated 137 million workers are in danger of losing their jobs in the next 20 years. Meanwhile, a study by the Oxford Martin School has found that 47 percent of jobs in the US will be automated in the next 20 years.</p></div>

<div><strong>Guess Which Side Obama Alums Took in a Debate Over Basic Income</strong> <small>2017-03-29 21:22:55</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Should all Americans be given a guaranteed basic income, just enough money that any person could scrape by on their monthly check from the government? New York City’s Upper West Side gave the idea a very firm no-vote last week.</p>
<p>“The universal basic income is supported across the political ideologies because it’s a fix efficient and flexible and humane and can end poverty once and for all,” former union chief Andy Stern said of the idea, but his case fell largely on deaf ears in the end.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea of a universal basic income has been taking up a lot more cultural space lately. Elite startup accelerator Y Combinator has been cooking up an experiment to test how cash without conditions compared to prescriptive help (such as support specifically for housing, job training, or child-rearing). The non-profit GiveDirectly is testing the same question, but in the developing world, which Annie Lowrey took a close look at for The New York Times Magazine. Wired even ran a science fiction story about a world in which everyone had a guaranteed income, called “The Hunger After You’re Fed.”</p>
<p>In technology circles, increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence will mean that there won’t be enough jobs out there for people. First, they will come for truck drivers, but eventually, they’ll take out writers, too. On the positive side, one could also argue that a basic income could open opportunities for entrepreneurship to strata of society too financially stressed to consider starting something today.</p></div>
<div><strong>Universal basic income debate sharpens as observers grasp for solutions to inequality</strong> <small>2017-03-27 16:20:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Is a guaranteed paycheck from the government, with no strings attached, the answer to the relentless rise of automation?</p>
<p>The concept might sound far-fetched, but a so-called universal basic income (UBI), is currently one of the most hotly debated policy topics being floated as a means to address income inequality and the disruption that technology poses to the workforce. UBI is being tested in Finland and other international markets, but has received decidedly mixed reactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, developments in robotics and artificial intelligence have grave implications for the labor force. A report issued this week from consulting firm PwC found that more than a third of U.S. jobs were at risk from automation, upping the ante for policy makers to cushion the blow to workers.</p>
<p>Advocates for UBI argue that a guaranteed paycheck could serve as a way to fight poverty and uncertainty in an evolving U.S. economy and encourage workers to take more risks in the job market if they had some extra money as a cushion.</p>
<p>The idea has gained prominent backers such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who recently told CNBC he supported UBI joining a growing list of tech execs who've voiced support for the concept as a solution to unemployment that will be caused by future automation and the rise of the robots. Silicon Valley's Y Combinator President Sam Altman and eBay Founder Pierre Omidyar have also expressed support for a universal income.</p></div>
<div><strong>Watch Live: Will Universal Basic Income Change Our Lives for Good or Bad?</strong> <small>2017-03-23 22:06:43</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Each year, robots and artificially intelligence systems cause unemployment rates to increase as more and more jobs become automated. And when you stop to take a look, the numbers are harrowing.</p>
<p>In Canada, a study conducted by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship found that a staggering 40 percent of Canadian jobs will be taken over by machines in the next few decades. In the United Kingdom, a study conducted by Oxford University and Deloitte, a business advisory firm, found that 850,000 public sector jobs in the region will likely be lost by 2030. In Southeast Asia, an estimated 137 million workers are in danger of losing their jobs in the next 20 years. Meanwhile, a study by the Oxford Martin School has found that 47 percent of jobs in the US will be automated in the next 20 years.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Education, U.S.</p>
<p>In the 25 years since Minnesota passed the first charter school law, these publicly funded but privately operated schools have become a highly sought-after alternative to traditional public education, particularly for underserved students in urban areas. Between 2004 and 2014 alone, charter school enrollment increased from less than 1 million to 2.5 million students. Many charter schools boast of high test scores, strict academic expectations, and high graduation rates, and for some, their growth is evidence of their success. But have these schools lived up to their promise? Opponents argue that charters, which are subject to fewer regulations and less oversight, lack accountability, take much-needed resources from public schools, and pick and choose their student body.  Are charter schools overrated?</p>

<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S., World</p>
<p>Over 70 years ago, in 1945, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia met onboard the USS Quincy.  A close relationship between the two countries has been maintained ever since, with oil and military and intelligence cooperation at its foundation.  But the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. shale revolution, human rights concerns, and diverging interests in the Middle East, have all put strains on this relationship.  Has this special relationship outlived its usefulness, or is it too important to walk away from?</p>

<div><strong>Should the U.S. maintain its alliance with Saudi Arabia? Unfortunately, we’re stuck with them</strong> <small>2017-02-27 17:05:00</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In late January, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and his son, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also the minister of defense, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the opening of the King Faisal Air Academy. On the occasion, the Saudis reportedly added to their fleet of warplanes a number of brand-new F-15SAs. The new planes are a variant of the Boeing-manufactured F-15 fighter jets and are part of a $29.4 billion deal signed in late 2011 that includes 84 new F-15SAs and an additional 68 of the F-15S variant that will be upgraded.</p>
<p>It was a big purchase, but the Saudis were not done. Since 2014, Riyadh has placed orders for another $30 billion worth of American weapons, the bulk of which were requisitioned after Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen began in March 2015. The Saudis have also spent another $22 billion on weapons from the United Kingdom and France. The numbers are staggering, making the House of Saud the second-largest importer of weapons in the world after India.</p>
<p>Recently, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/special-us-saudi-relationship-has-outlived-its-usefulness) on the motion that the special U.S.-Saudi relationship has outlived its usefulness. At the end of the discussion, which pitted two teams of two experts against each other, 56 percent of those in attendance were convinced that Saudi Arabia should remain a strategic ally. Based on weapons sales alone, Saudi Arabia is undoubtedly a strategic partner of and effectively a jobs program for the American defense industry. A more appropriate question for the event might have been, “Is Saudi Arabia a competent ally?”</p></div>
<div><strong>Has the U.S.-Saudi Relationship Outlived Its Usefulness?</strong> <small>2017-02-21 16:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., or IQ2US, organizes a regular series of debates on issues of public concern and broadcasts them via livestreaming, NPR, YouTube, and podcasts. The organization’s purpose, proudly proclaimed, is “to restore civility, reasoned analysis, and constructive public discourse to today’s often biased media landscape.” (Since it sounds a lot like me, I tend to like it.) The most recent debate, which I had the honor to attend, posed the provocative proposition “The Special U.S.-Saudi Relationship Has Outlived Its Usefulness.”</p>
<p>The debaters arguing for the proposition were Madawi Al Rasheed,* a Visiting Professor at the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics and a research fellow at the Open Society Foundation, and Mark P. Lagon, Centennial Fellow and Distinguished Senior Scholar at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and former Ambassador-at-Large in charge of the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.</p>
<p>Arguing against the proposition were F. Gregory Gause III, the John H. Lindsey ’44 Professor of International Affairs and head of the International Affairs Department at Texas A&M University, and James Jeffrey, a Visiting Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and formerly Deputy National Security Advisor and Ambassador to Albania, Turkey, and Iraq.</p>
<p>Life, of course, is not really as binary as a debate proposition, and in reality neither was the debate. No one said that the United States should abandon its relationship with Saudi Arabia altogether, and no one claimed that there were no problems. While that might strike debate professionals as a bit sloppy on the edges, it does mesh well with the world as we know it.</p></div>

<p>On the heels of a deeply polarized election, Donald Trump assumed office having won the Electoral College, 306 to 232, but having lost the popular vote by over 2.8 million voters.  His opponents argue that he gave voice and legitimacy to extremists, and that his unpredictable, autocratic style is a threat to both democratic ideals at home, and stability abroad.  But others, including critics, argue that Trump’s election represents the will of the American people, who--hungry for change--repudiated the status quo.  In their view, we must find areas of common ground to work together, because obstructionism would only deepen the political divide, and a paralyzed government would benefit no one.  Should we give President Trump a chance?</p>

<div><strong>GW debate sways audience against giving Trump a chance</strong> <small>2017-02-13 19:49:58</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>George Washington University hosted a debate Wednesday night about whether or not President Donald Trump should be given a chance to govern in the Oval Office, and the con side won a clear victory, at least with the live audience.</p>
<p>The debate titled “Give Trump a Chance? (https://opentodebate.org/debates/give-trump-chance)” featured David Frum, senior editor for The Atlantic, and Brennan Center for Justice President Michael Waldman arguing against giving the president a chance, with Bloomberg View columnist Clive Cook and political analyst and attorney Gayle Trotter making the case that Trump should be given a chance to pursue the policies he campaigned on.</p>
<p>“The premise of this debate is wrong,” Trotter provocatively began her introductory statement, arguing that the real issue isn’t whether people should like Trump, or whether he’s president, because the fact remains that Trump is “the current occupant in the Oval Office.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t have this debate when Barack Obama won the election and reelection," Trotter observed, and while she acknowledged that Trump may have flaws, especially personal ones, she also touted his ability to overcome social problems because he “tapped into the patriotism of his fellow Americans.”</p></div>
<div><strong>For skeptical Americans, a debate over whether to give Trump a chance</strong> <small>2017-02-13 19:41:43</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>After all, giving newly inaugurated presidents the opportunity to govern, and show what they can accomplish, is part of America's great democratic tradition. Even former President Barack Obama, no fan of Mr. Trump, urged forbearance in the early going.</p>
<p>“Let him make his decisions,” Mr. Obama said soon after the election.</p>
<p>But the reality hasn’t been so simple. Trump is no ordinary president. And from Day One, Americans have responded to his insurgent presidency in no ordinary way, from deep satisfaction that the political establishment has been upended, to vocal resistance, street protests, and warnings of incipient autocracy.</p>
<p>By Day 10, Obama had already broken his silence, saying he "fundamentally disagree[d]" with Trump's executive order temporarily curbing immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.</p>
<p>But some Trump skeptics say the smarter long-term strategy should be, in fact, to let him govern unfettered by his opponents’ obstructionism and constant outrage and then if his policies don’t pan out, Trump will have no one to blame but himself.</p></div>
<div><strong>Give Trump A Chance?</strong> <small>2017-02-13 19:37:56</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I've known David Frum almost since I first came to Washington. A mutual friend of ours once described him thusly: "David is one of the handful of people in this town whose intellect is genuinely intimidating." That appraisal always struck me as pretty much correct.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Frum is personally intimidating he's very much a good guy. But rather than whenever he says something I disagree with, I begin my assessment with the assumption that I am likely mistaken.</p>
<p>Which is what happened last week. Frum participated in an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate in Washington arguing against the following proposition: We should give Trump a chance to succeed as president.</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking: How could you be against giving Trump a chance? Heck, how could you be against giving anyone a chance? In any situation. "Give the other guy a chance" is practically part of the American credo. Shouldn't Trump skeptics (like myself) at the very least, as Clive Crook says during the debate, not close our minds "to the possibility that he might do some good things"?</p>
<p>But as I said, Frum is worth taking seriously even when you think he's totally wrong.</p></div>

<p>WAS JANUARY 6TH AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT? (https://opentodebate.org/debate/was-january-6th-an-existential-threat-to-american-democracy/#/)

Andrew Keen, host of the “How to Fix Democracy” podcast, will argue against the notion of peril (https://opentodebate.org/debate/was-january-6th-an-existential-threat-to-american-democracy/#/), squaring off against election strategist Rebekah Caruthers.</p></div>

<div class='news-content'><p>Should Trump Be Indicted?</p>
<p>After a series of prime-time hearings from the January 6th Committee and hundreds of charges against individuals who participated in the events of that day, the Department of Justice faces a complex political and legal question: Should it charge Donald Trump with federal crimes? Those calling on Attorney General Merrick Garland to act argue that no person is above the law and that the Committee's investigations have unearthed more than enough evidence to bring a variety of charges against the former president. But still, others warn that indicting a former president who has signaled interest in returning to the campaign trail in 2024 and who enjoys considerable support in the Republican party will even further fraction the nation's political divisions. Would indicting President Trump set a dangerous precedent and deepen political hostility in the run-up to a major presidential election? Or would failing to indict him prove even worse?</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>There are many issues in our lives where neutral opinions are replaced with hard-line views. Should the toilet paper roll be over or under when placed on the holder? Should ketchup be used as a condiment for breakfast, or is it strictly for french fries and burgers? Is there a place for a mullet in polite society?</p></div>
<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer. As we now know, the inspector general of the State Department did not find she had violated any criminal laws and FBI Director James Comey – no Hillary Clinton fan – agreed that not one of the 33,000 emails she transferred to her private server contained recognizable classified markings.</p>
<p>But that example cuts both ways. Yes, it is obviously hypocritical for Trump and his supporters to scream about due process in the Colorado case. But Mrs. Clinton’s example also shows why due process is so important. She was never convicted of anything. And, so far at least, neither has Trump.</p>
<p>Winning a criminal insurrection conspiracy case won’t be a cakewalk for Special Counsel Jack Smith. I say this because on Dec. 14 I participated as playing Smith’s role as “prosecutor” in a mock trial sponsored by the nationally respected nonprofit organization Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/). Our mock argument was live-streamed last week, but it can be heard again on Jan. 5, 2024, the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection effort, on an NPR local affiliate; seen and heard on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AQxFtqh-4); on opentodebate.org; or on available podcast channels.</p>
<p>During this mock trial, the Trump side was represented by Sara Azari (https://www.azarilaw.com/sara-azari), a Los Angeles-based defense lawyer. Sara argued not only the absence of a smoking gun admission or written evidence by Trump that he knew he had lost the election; she also effectively argued that Trump’s claims, though false, are protected as political speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>My response was that the First Amendment does not protect lies that are part of a criminal conspiracy. I pointed out that there will be testimony from several people that Trump admitted he had lost but lied about it. However, I also pointed out that a jury can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the voter fraud did not cost him the election because the highest officials of his government, whom he appointed, all told him he had lost, including the attorney general, senior Justice Department officials, the director of national intelligence, and every single state official in the key battleground states whom he called. Georgia’s secretary of state of told him he had lost after three separate recounts. Still Trump asked him to “find” one vote more than the total Biden was found to have won Georgia – proving he knew he was asking the secretary of state to lie.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that 61 out of 61 state court judges rejected his claim that he had lost these key battleground states because of voter fraud. (Once in Pennsylvania, a court found some voter fraud, but that judge also ruled it wasn’t significant enough to change the outcome in that state).</p>
<p>In any event, there will and must be a test of Donald Trump’s culpability, but that must come in a trial, with due process by a finder of fact that reaches a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. America cannot accept a verdict barring Trump from running for office based on a court hearing 1,500 miles from Washington, D.C., without a trial, on a civil court standard of “preponderance of the evidence” – meaning anything above 50%.</p>
<p>Those of us who oppose Trump can beat him at the ballot box, especially if and when he is convicted of felonies in one or more of the criminal trials he faces in federal and state courts. Colorado’s chief justice was right in his dissent when he concluded Trump should not be barred by a state court “in the absence of an insurrection-related conviction” – the latter word meaning after a trial and a jury of his peers finds the defendant guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Lanny Davis is the founder of the Washington, D.C., law firm, Lanny J. Davis & Associates. He is one of the first to use the concept of legal crisis management to solve client problems – operating at the intersection of law, media, and politics. He is a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton in 1996-98 and served on a privacy and civil liberties panel appointed by President George W. Bush.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>On the heels of a deeply polarized election, Donald Trump assumed office having won the Electoral College, 306 to 232, but having lost the popular vote by over 2.8 million voters.  His opponents argue that he gave voice and legitimacy to extremists, and that his unpredictable, autocratic style is a threat to both democratic ideals at home, and stability abroad.  But others, including critics, argue that Trump’s election represents the will of the American people, who--hungry for change--repudiated the status quo.  In their view, we must find areas of common ground to work together, because obstructionism would only deepen the political divide, and a paralyzed government would benefit no one.  Should we give President Trump a chance?</p>

<p>In 2014, the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, set off a wave of protests and sparked a movement targeting racial disparities in criminal justice.  Since then, there have been other controversial deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement that have captured the public’s attention, from Tamir Rice, to Philando Castile.  But there are some who say that these encounters, many of them recorded, have fed a narrative of biased policing that the data does not back up, vilifying people who are trying to do good in a difficult job that often puts them in harm’s way.  What are the statistics, and how should we interpret them?  How have recent incidents shaped our view of policing?  Does crime drive law enforcement’s use of force, or is there racial bias?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> January 11, 2017</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>In 2014, the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, set off a wave of protests and sparked a movement targeting racial disparities in criminal justice.  Since then, there have been other controversial deaths of African Americans at the hands of law enforcement that have captured the public’s attention, from Tamir Rice, to Philando Castile.  But there are some who say that these encounters, many of them recorded, have fed a narrative of biased policing that the data does not back up, vilifying people who are trying to do good in a difficult job that often puts them in harm’s way.  What are the statistics, and how should we interpret them?  How have recent incidents shaped our view of policing?  Does crime drive law enforcement’s use of force, or is there racial bias?</p>
