<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, Politics, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p>The digital currency craze started with just one anonymous Bitcoin founder, whose identity is still unknown, and a community of futuristic, tech-savvy investors willing to take a bet on a new form of money. But over the past decade, the world of digital currency has coined a host of new types of online cash. In fact, Central Banks in more than 80 countries have, or are in the process of gearing their monetary systems in that direction. They consider them a means of modernizing and serving as a check against the growth of crypto. In China, an estimated 140 million people have already begun using the new digital yuan, which accounts for nearly $10 billion worth of transactions. In that context, does the world's reserve currency -- the U.S. dollar -- need its own version? Those who are argue “yes” say it is a fundamental step to remain competitive; to ensure the dollar remains in its preferred global standing. A digital dollar, they argue, would also create a new ease of exchange, reduce delays in processing times, and help the underbanked Americans into the digital economy. Those who argue “no” point to the risks of failure, hackings, and privacy breaches, which includes widespread government tracking of transactions, and could allow for unprecedented federal access to personal banks accounts. Against this backdrop, we ask: Should Uncle Sam adopt the digital dollar?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education, Law, Politics</p>
<p>An affirmative action battle is again playing out at the highest levels, only this time with Asian Americans at the center of the controversy. At the heart of the matter is the question of whether the Supreme Court should reconsider race in college admissions. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, has taken aim at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, alleging that Asian Americans are less likely to be admitted than comparably qualified white, Black, or Latino applicants. In two separate cases, the group claims that 1.) Harvard’s admissions policy is regressive and discriminates against Asian Americans, and 2.) UNC – which is a public institution and therefore covered by the 14th amendment’s equal protection guarantee – violates both Title VI and the Constitution with its use of race in admissions. But opponents say race-conscious decision making is a necessary tool to address longstanding racism and discrimination. As such, in this timely debate, we ask the question of whether affirmative action is indeed unfair to Asian Americans.</p>

<div><strong>Open to Debate / Intelligence Squared U.S. Podcast Asks: Is Affirmative Action Unfair To Asian Americans?</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:13:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Affirmative action is one of those issues that nags at people, irrespective of their view on its efficacy. For some, affirmative action offends their sense of fairness and raises their emotional thermostat because someone’s cutting in line. For others, affirmative action is a remedy for a long-standing societal illness — discrimination against a group or multiple groups. Finally, other people view a college campus as a “Cobb salad,” where many different ingredients are tossed into one bowl and one delicious food item results. To them, a college campus of, say, only one kind of cheese is just wrong.</p>
<p>It should never be said that the people at the Open to Debate formerly, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. have shied away from a debate on a contentious issue. In fact, they know that it’s these issues that make for the most lively and edifying debates.</p>
<p>For some listeners, the concept of a debate may be an alien concept. Why? Because most media outlets, such as Fox News, allow one point of view, making their channel a “safe space” for the “one true political viewpoint.” When a contrary voice is invited on the network, they are often yelled at and talked over until they give up or the network goes to a commercial when that guest begins to score some debate points.</p>
<p>In real debates, people don’t yell or scream or call each other names. For millions, it will be an alien concept.</p>
<p>But listening to a true debate is a cleansing process. It’s like your intellect gets a good deep scrubbing. Lies are washed away. Alternative facts are not allowed. Insults have no place. Suddenly, your entire belief system is hosed down and then rebooted back to its factory default.</p>
<p>With that preface, the new episode of nonpartisan debate podcast Intelligence Squared U.S. asks a provocative question: “Is Affirmative Action Unfair to Asian Americans?”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is likely to issue a ruling related to this topic in the coming months, having recently heard arguments in the case Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, Intelligence Squared presents arguments on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>“Arguments on both sides of the issue.” A novel concept these days, but, oh, so refreshing.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion is Lee Cheng, Co-founder of the Asian American Coalition for Education who also worked in the Harvard College admissions process as an alumni interviewer for nearly 25 years. Arguing against is John Yang, President of Asian Americans Advancing Justice who has worked with the White House and Senate in securing the nomination and confirmation of over 20 Asian American and Pacific Islander federal judges.</p>

<div><strong>Open to Debate / Intelligence Squared U.S. Podcast Asks: Is Affirmative Action Unfair To Asian Americans?</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:13:12</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Affirmative action is one of those issues that nags at people, irrespective of their view on its efficacy. For some, affirmative action offends their sense of fairness and raises their emotional thermostat because someone’s cutting in line. For others, affirmative action is a remedy for a long-standing societal illness — discrimination against a group or multiple groups. Finally, other people view a college campus as a “Cobb salad,” where many different ingredients are tossed into one bowl and one delicious food item results. To them, a college campus of, say, only one kind of cheese is just wrong.</p>
<p>It should never be said that the people at the Open to Debate formerly, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. have shied away from a debate on a contentious issue. In fact, they know that it’s these issues that make for the most lively and edifying debates.</p>
<p>For some listeners, the concept of a debate may be an alien concept. Why? Because most media outlets, such as Fox News, allow one point of view, making their channel a “safe space” for the “one true political viewpoint.” When a contrary voice is invited on the network, they are often yelled at and talked over until they give up or the network goes to a commercial when that guest begins to score some debate points.</p>
<p>In real debates, people don’t yell or scream or call each other names. For millions, it will be an alien concept.</p>
<p>But listening to a true debate is a cleansing process. It’s like your intellect gets a good deep scrubbing. Lies are washed away. Alternative facts are not allowed. Insults have no place. Suddenly, your entire belief system is hosed down and then rebooted back to its factory default.</p>
<p>With that preface, the new episode of nonpartisan debate podcast Intelligence Squared U.S. asks a provocative question: “Is Affirmative Action Unfair to Asian Americans?”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is likely to issue a ruling related to this topic in the coming months, having recently heard arguments in the case Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.</p>
<p>Ahead of that, Intelligence Squared presents arguments on both sides of the issue.</p>
<p>“Arguments on both sides of the issue.” A novel concept these days, but, oh, so refreshing.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion is Lee Cheng, Co-founder of the Asian American Coalition for Education who also worked in the Harvard College admissions process as an alumni interviewer for nearly 25 years. Arguing against is John Yang, President of Asian Americans Advancing Justice who has worked with the White House and Senate in securing the nomination and confirmation of over 20 Asian American and Pacific Islander federal judges.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p>The age of “information disorder” is upon us. Deep fakes, false political narratives, and flawed COVID rumors are all rampant online, threatening America’s national security, as well as democracy itself. Though bad actors have always had the capacity to deceive, the ease, speed, and degree to which anyone can create misleading information has engendered a dangerous new world. And yet many solutions can also run directly against longstanding western principles, such as free speech and a lack of censorship. Prescriptions, some argue, can be as dangerous as the disorder itself. So, what can be done? In partnership with the Homeland Security Experts Group, Intelligence Squared U.S. debates how to combat this dangerous new phenomenon, termed “information disorder.” Our expert panel takes a look at what the private sector should do, what the public sector can do, and how political actors who spread false information should be handled.
This debate took place in front of a live audience, at the 2022 Homeland Security Enterprise Forum, on October 25, 2022. The debate is presented and produced in partnership with the Homeland Security Experts Group.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p>The age of “information disorder” is upon us. Deep fakes, false political narratives, and flawed COVID rumors are all rampant online, threatening America’s national security, as well as democracy itself. Though bad actors have always had the capacity to deceive, the ease, speed, and degree to which anyone can create misleading information has engendered a dangerous new world. And yet many solutions can also run directly against longstanding western principles, such as free speech and a lack of censorship. Prescriptions, some argue, can be as dangerous as the disorder itself. So, what can be done? In partnership with the Homeland Security Experts Group, Intelligence Squared U.S. debates how to combat this dangerous new phenomenon, termed “information disorder.” Our expert panel takes a look at what the private sector should do, what the public sector can do, and how political actors who spread false information should be handled.
This debate took place in front of a live audience, at the 2022 Homeland Security Enterprise Forum, on October 25, 2022. The debate is presented and produced in partnership with the Homeland Security Experts Group.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution has a lot to say about elections. But nowhere is there any mention of political primaries, the process by which candidates are winnowed down ahead of a general election. Though they may seem integral to the U.S. system, primaries in fact are a relatively new phenomenon, borne of the turn of the 20th century when reformers sought to wrangle power from political party bosses. Of course, quite a lot has changed since the days of Tammany Hall. Gerrymandering has greatly reduced competitive districts, while the urban-rural divide has grown exponentially. Divisions run deep, with social media capable of dramatically shifting the political landscape at unprecedented speed. Many see primary elections as a principal culprit of what they consider an undermined democracy, fueling extremism, hindering compromise, and lending too much power to partisans. Others argue that primaries are an important bulwark against political corruption and a hedge against elitism. In this context, we ask: Are Primary Elections Ruining Democracy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>How does one balance two important, though at times competing, public interests? In this case, it’s the need to hold public officials accountable versus the need to shield those officials from harassment and legal liability. In 1967, the US Supreme Court lay the foundations of an answer during a case involving two police officers, sued over civil rights violations carried out at a segregated bus stop in Jackson, Mississippi. The court effectively ruled that if unconstitutional arrests were made in good faith and with probable cause, officers then enjoyed a degree of legal immunity. That case then served as bedrock for a legal doctrine that later came to be known as “qualified immunity;” a concept that effectively provides government officials with immunity from civil suits in certain circumstances. In 1982, the court went further, codifying qualified immunity for officials and rendering subjective intent of the official immaterial. In other words, whether or not a defendant was acting in good faith was effectively considered irrelevant. Under the revised doctrine, cases could proceed to trial only when there was a clear violation of “established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Since then, critics have argued that this doctrine stands as a central barrier to substantive police reform, allowing officers to more easily to kill or injure with impunity. But advocates say it’s a necessary protection, shielding police officers – who are tasked with making split-second life-and-death decisions – from bankruptcy and vindictive personal lawsuits. In this context, we debate this question: Is It Time to End Qualified Immunity for Cops?</p>

<p>How does one balance two important, though at times competing, public interests? In this case, it’s the need to hold public officials accountable versus the need to shield those officials from harassment and legal liability. In 1967, the US Supreme Court lay the foundations of an answer during a case involving two police officers, sued over civil rights violations carried out at a segregated bus stop in Jackson, Mississippi. The court effectively ruled that if unconstitutional arrests were made in good faith and with probable cause, officers then enjoyed a degree of legal immunity. That case then served as bedrock for a legal doctrine that later came to be known as “qualified immunity;” a concept that effectively provides government officials with immunity from civil suits in certain circumstances. In 1982, the court went further, codifying qualified immunity for officials and rendering subjective intent of the official immaterial. In other words, whether or not a defendant was acting in good faith was effectively considered irrelevant. Under the revised doctrine, cases could proceed to trial only when there was a clear violation of “established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.” Since then, critics have argued that this doctrine stands as a central barrier to substantive police reform, allowing officers to more easily to kill or injure with impunity. But advocates say it’s a necessary protection, shielding police officers – who are tasked with making split-second life-and-death decisions – from bankruptcy and vindictive personal lawsuits.

<p>Unions may be on the verge of a resurgence. After decades of declines, workers are organizing across household-name companies, like Starbucks, Amazon, and Google, at a pace not seen since the 1930s. A generation of stagnant wages, recent labor shortages, and the most vocally pro-union administration in recent memory, have all stoked key wins for American labor, including successful strikes at John Deere and Kellogg. In fact, recent polling shows public support for labor unions at 71%, its highest level since 1965. During the old industrialization days, unions were credited with securing better wages, reasonable hours, and safer conditions. They applied broad influence over the American economy. But their power waned. In 1983, one in 5 employees belonged to a union. Last year, that number had dwindled to one in 10, with most of the declines occurring in the private sector. Some say good riddance. They that argue unions actually hurt workers and the economy under the guise of supporting both. Union dues sap salaries, they say, and can actually increase unemployment. They also make the economy more rigid to change, raise consumer prices, and ultimately render unionized organizations less competitive. Advocates, however, argue that in light of yawning income inequalities, unions are desperately needed. They increase pay and benefit workers, they say. Unions can also settle disputes more equitably, while encouraging a more robust middle class. Of course, not all unions are created equal. And the difference between the private and public sector needs to be explored. Yet in light of recent widespread public support for organized labor more broadly, an overarching question looms large: Do Unions Work For The Economy?
This debate took place in front of a live audience, at the Comedy Cellar's The Village Underground, on October 12, 2022. The debate is presented and produced in partnership with The Village Underground live debate series "No Laughing Matter".</p>

<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>How Unions Work for the Economy</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:19:44</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A few weeks ago, a producer from Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a media company that organizes debates, called me and asked me to explain a few things about labor unions and to discuss whether they help or hurt the economy. I was happy to oblige, talking to her for twenty minutes or so, and I was very surprised the next day when she invited me to participate in a debate in which the question would be “Do Unions Work for the Economy?” I was to argue, yes, they do work for the economy.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been in a formal debate since sixth grade, when I got my butt kicked. Back then, I argued “yes” in a debate in which the question was “Are Comic Books Bad for Kids?” After that debate ended, my comics-loving classmates gave me and my argument an overwhelming thumbs down.</p>
<p>During the week before the Intelligence Squared debate was to take place (at the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village), I plunged into research to make the case that unions work for the economy and to respond to my opponent’s expected arguments that unions are bad for the economy.</p>
<p>My opponent for the evening was Allison Schrager, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and—unlike my earlier debate—it was an enjoyable experience to engage with her in such a thoughtful, good-spirited discussion. For those of you who are wondering—and of course not at all to boast—I will note that, according to the metrics Intelligence Squared used that evening, I won the debate.</p>
<p>Below in written, non-debate form, I seek to explain, in some detail, how unions work for the economy—while also seeking to rebut arguments that unions do not work for the economy.</p>
<p>For a moment, I should first discuss what we mean when we say “the economy.” When some people discuss the economy, they typically focus on things like maximizing corporate profits or boosting the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But the economy is about far more than that. The economy isn’t so much about corporations as it is about people—about delivering goods and services, not to mention income and wealth, to make people’s lives better.</p>
<p>Unions, by and large, help make people’s lives better. If unions are about anything, they’re about creating broadly shared prosperity, about lifting pay for workers and reducing gaps between rich and poor, about making sure that jobs are safe, and about assuring that people have health coverage and enough for retirement and also have work-life balance that gives them time to be with their families. In these ways, unions very much work for the economy.</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate Podcast Goes Live About Unions</strong> <small>2023-02-07 21:00:21</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>About 70 years ago, nearly 40 percent of all American workers were in a labor union. That number today is seven percent. While labor unions have a checkered history that includes corruption, mob influence, and promoting violence, there’s no doubt that the withering away of union influence is one major reason why the average pay of the American worker has been stagnant for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>But unions are making some noise.</p>
<p>American railroad workers are threatening a strike. Those in France are in the throes of one. Amazon workers in New York decided against unionizing. Apple workers in Oklahoma voted overwhelmingly to join one. Everywhere you look, unions are more and more a part of the conversation. They’ve represented workers under U.S. labor law since 1935. And recent polling shows support is up around 71%, the highest in decades. But a more fundamental question persists: Do unions work? And more specifically, do they work for the economy?</p>
<p>Some say “NO.” Unemployment swells, prices inflate, and companies grow less competitive with unions in the mix, they say. Others argue “YES,” pointing to pay and benefit increases, and arguing that unions encourage a more robust middle class.</p>
<p>A new podcast and video from nonpartisan debate series Open to Debate asks the question: “Do Unions Work For The Economy?” (https://opentodebate.org/debate/do-unions-work-for-the-economy/#/)</p>
<p>Arguing in support of unions’ impact on the modern economy is longtime New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse, who now writes about wages and working conditions at The Century Foundation. Opposing him is economist Allison Schrager, who studies tax and monetary policy at the Manhattan Institute.</p>

<div><strong>Is the American Dream Attainable?</strong> <small>2023-03-23 02:26:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The American dream! Popularized by historian James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America, the term described that dream of a land in which life should be better richer, and fuller for everyone. After World War II, the American dream evolved into homeownership, a happy family, and summer vacations. Some people even aspired to get a degree. The G.I. Bill helped make the dream possible. That generation, known as the baby boomers, expected their children to do even better.</p>
<p>Why the American dream fades
In recent decades, the concept of the American dream has been deteriorating. Whereas upward mobility once seemed attainable for almost everyone, today's economy has left people struggling to afford basic necessities, let alone to save for their future. "Only half of today's 30-year-olds earn more than their parents when they were at the same age" according to Visual Capitalist (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/). No longer does having a good job with benefits equate to owning a home and having a family with two kids, a car, and a dog.</p>
<p>What has caused this shift? For starters: stagnating wage growth, uneven income distribution, increase in the cost of living, and erosion of benefits. Younger generations are forced to rethink the American dream and to accept that a 9-to-5 job is not enough. Americans should focus on building passive income that will complement and eventually replace their current wages. Let's take a look at the factors preventing upward mobility.</p>
<p>Stunted growth
According to a Venture Capitalist article (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/), the average hourly rate was $22.65 in 2018 versus $20.27 in 1964, after inflation adjustments. That represents a mere 11.7% increase over a span of 54 years, which represents a 0.2% annual increase above inflation.</p>
<p>A 2014 Economic Policy Institute analysis (https://www.epi.org/multimedia/income-inequality-american-dream-debate/) found that fewer people in the lower and middle classes were actually climbing the economic ladder today. In turn, they made less than their parents. As Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S (https://opentodebate.org/debates/income-inequality-impairs-american-dream-upward-mobility)reported, In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. What led to this phenomenon? Unequal income distribution, where those at the top receive much more than those on the bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of income stagnation and unequal income distribution are technology, automation, offshore resources, and independent contracting. More and more corporations are pushing governments and workers into a gig economy by allowing them to hire contractors and avoid the protection afforded to employees. The recent adoption of California Proposition 22 (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22) opens the gate to other companies using independent contractors rather than hiring employees.</p>
<p>Wage stagnation would not be a critical issue if prices had risen at the same rate as inflation, but that hasn't been the case. Health premiums rose 3% above inflation every year over 10 years, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation survey (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.1001?utm_campaign=HASU%3A+10-05-18+%28Copy%29&utm_medium=email&vgo_ee=TQLYTaMUxLuVgns98nuK7Q%3D%3D&utm_content=Health+Affairs++October+Issue%3A+Social+Determinants%2C+Drug+++Device+Prices+++More%3B+2018+Costs+For+Employer-Sponsored+Family+Health+Coverage%3B+Aftermath+Of+A+School+Shooting&utm_source=Newsletter&). That is not taking into account the independent contractors who would have to pay out of pocket often at a much higher premium than when working as an employee.</p>
<p>The average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a four-year institution (http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) rose from $16,590 in 1995 (in 2017 dollars) to $27,357 in 2017 a 2.3% annual increase above inflation. Median house prices have gone from $200,000 to $300,000 over the same period. That's a 1.8% increase on top of inflation. We are seeing similar trends in prices for child-car, gas, and cars all have drastically increased since 1990, while wages have practically stayed the same.</p>
<p>Creating a new dream
Not all hope is lost, however. Whereas previous generations could be complacent about their future, today's millennials and younger generations must take a more proactive approach to secure their dreams. As mentioned above, this requires a shift in mindset. Instead of focusing just on maintaining a 9-to-5 job and saving up for retirement, it would be wise to build passive income. Passive income can help you not just maintain your wealth but also continue to grow it and save toward your future.</p>
<p>There are many ways to earn passive income. My personal expertise is in turnkey rentals (http://marteleric.com/). Owning a turnkey single-family rental is a great, fast way to earn passive income while working or during retirement. Investing in a turnkey property means you buy a rental home or apartment that has already been fixed up and rented through a property management company. You buy it, managers run it, and you collect the profits.</p>
<p>The American dream is still alive. It just requires a shift in mindset and a more proactive approach. Whereas previous generations could be more complacent about their future, today you must take action or your standard of living could easily slide toward poverty. Acquiring passive income is the surest way to secure your future success.</p></div>

<p>Unions may be on the verge of a resurgence. After decades of declines, workers are organizing across household-name companies, like Starbucks, Amazon, and Google, at a pace not seen since the 1930s. A generation of stagnant wages, recent labor shortages, and the most vocally pro-union administration in recent memory, have all stoked key wins for American labor, including successful strikes at John Deere and Kellogg. In fact, recent polling shows public support for labor unions at 71%, its highest level since 1965. During the old industrialization days, unions were credited with securing better wages, reasonable hours, and safer conditions. They applied broad influence over the American economy. But their power waned. In 1983, one in 5 employees belonged to a union. Last year, that number had dwindled to one in 10, with most of the declines occurring in the private sector. Some say good riddance. They that argue unions actually hurt workers and the economy under the guise of supporting both. Union dues sap salaries, they say, and can actually increase unemployment. They also make the economy more rigid to change, raise consumer prices, and ultimately render unionized organizations less competitive. Advocates, however, argue that in light of yawning income inequalities, unions are desperately needed. They increase pay and benefit workers, they say. Unions can also settle disputes more equitably, while encouraging a more robust middle class. Of course, not all unions are created equal. And the difference between the private and public sector needs to be explored. Yet in light of recent widespread public support for organized labor more broadly, an overarching question looms large: Do Unions Work For The Economy?
This debate took place in front of a live audience, at the Comedy Cellar's The Village Underground, on October 12, 2022. The debate is presented and produced in partnership with The Village Underground live debate series "No Laughing Matter".</p>

<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>How Unions Work for the Economy</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:19:44</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A few weeks ago, a producer from Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S., a media company that organizes debates, called me and asked me to explain a few things about labor unions and to discuss whether they help or hurt the economy. I was happy to oblige, talking to her for twenty minutes or so, and I was very surprised the next day when she invited me to participate in a debate in which the question would be “Do Unions Work for the Economy?” I was to argue, yes, they do work for the economy.</p>
<p>I hadn’t been in a formal debate since sixth grade, when I got my butt kicked. Back then, I argued “yes” in a debate in which the question was “Are Comic Books Bad for Kids?” After that debate ended, my comics-loving classmates gave me and my argument an overwhelming thumbs down.</p>
<p>During the week before the Intelligence Squared debate was to take place (at the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village), I plunged into research to make the case that unions work for the economy and to respond to my opponent’s expected arguments that unions are bad for the economy.</p>
<p>My opponent for the evening was Allison Schrager, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and—unlike my earlier debate—it was an enjoyable experience to engage with her in such a thoughtful, good-spirited discussion. For those of you who are wondering—and of course not at all to boast—I will note that, according to the metrics Intelligence Squared used that evening, I won the debate.</p>
<p>Below in written, non-debate form, I seek to explain, in some detail, how unions work for the economy—while also seeking to rebut arguments that unions do not work for the economy.</p>
<p>For a moment, I should first discuss what we mean when we say “the economy.” When some people discuss the economy, they typically focus on things like maximizing corporate profits or boosting the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But the economy is about far more than that. The economy isn’t so much about corporations as it is about people—about delivering goods and services, not to mention income and wealth, to make people’s lives better.</p>
<p>Unions, by and large, help make people’s lives better. If unions are about anything, they’re about creating broadly shared prosperity, about lifting pay for workers and reducing gaps between rich and poor, about making sure that jobs are safe, and about assuring that people have health coverage and enough for retirement and also have work-life balance that gives them time to be with their families. In these ways, unions very much work for the economy.</p></div>
<div><strong>Open to Debate Podcast Goes Live About Unions</strong> <small>2023-02-07 21:00:21</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>About 70 years ago, nearly 40 percent of all American workers were in a labor union. That number today is seven percent. While labor unions have a checkered history that includes corruption, mob influence, and promoting violence, there’s no doubt that the withering away of union influence is one major reason why the average pay of the American worker has been stagnant for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>But unions are making some noise.</p>
<p>American railroad workers are threatening a strike. Those in France are in the throes of one. Amazon workers in New York decided against unionizing. Apple workers in Oklahoma voted overwhelmingly to join one. Everywhere you look, unions are more and more a part of the conversation. They’ve represented workers under U.S. labor law since 1935. And recent polling shows support is up around 71%, the highest in decades. But a more fundamental question persists: Do unions work? And more specifically, do they work for the economy?</p>
<p>Some say “NO.” Unemployment swells, prices inflate, and companies grow less competitive with unions in the mix, they say. Others argue “YES,” pointing to pay and benefit increases, and arguing that unions encourage a more robust middle class.</p>
<p>A new podcast and video from nonpartisan debate series Open to Debate asks the question: “Do Unions Work For The Economy?” (https://opentodebate.org/debate/do-unions-work-for-the-economy/#/)</p>
<p>Arguing in support of unions’ impact on the modern economy is longtime New York Times reporter Steven Greenhouse, who now writes about wages and working conditions at The Century Foundation. Opposing him is economist Allison Schrager, who studies tax and monetary policy at the Manhattan Institute.</p>

<div><strong>Is the American Dream Attainable?</strong> <small>2023-03-23 02:26:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The American dream! Popularized by historian James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America, the term described that dream of a land in which life should be better richer, and fuller for everyone. After World War II, the American dream evolved into homeownership, a happy family, and summer vacations. Some people even aspired to get a degree. The G.I. Bill helped make the dream possible. That generation, known as the baby boomers, expected their children to do even better.</p>
<p>Why the American dream fades
In recent decades, the concept of the American dream has been deteriorating. Whereas upward mobility once seemed attainable for almost everyone, today's economy has left people struggling to afford basic necessities, let alone to save for their future. "Only half of today's 30-year-olds earn more than their parents when they were at the same age" according to Visual Capitalist (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/). No longer does having a good job with benefits equate to owning a home and having a family with two kids, a car, and a dog.</p>
<p>What has caused this shift? For starters: stagnating wage growth, uneven income distribution, increase in the cost of living, and erosion of benefits. Younger generations are forced to rethink the American dream and to accept that a 9-to-5 job is not enough. Americans should focus on building passive income that will complement and eventually replace their current wages. Let's take a look at the factors preventing upward mobility.</p>
<p>Stunted growth
According to a Venture Capitalist article (https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-decline-of-upward-mobility-in-one-chart/), the average hourly rate was $22.65 in 2018 versus $20.27 in 1964, after inflation adjustments. That represents a mere 11.7% increase over a span of 54 years, which represents a 0.2% annual increase above inflation.</p>
<p>A 2014 Economic Policy Institute analysis (https://www.epi.org/multimedia/income-inequality-american-dream-debate/) found that fewer people in the lower and middle classes were actually climbing the economic ladder today. In turn, they made less than their parents. As Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S (https://opentodebate.org/debates/income-inequality-impairs-american-dream-upward-mobility)reported, In the last 30 years, the wages of the top 1% have grown by 154%, while the bottom 90% has seen growth of only 17%. What led to this phenomenon? Unequal income distribution, where those at the top receive much more than those on the bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of income stagnation and unequal income distribution are technology, automation, offshore resources, and independent contracting. More and more corporations are pushing governments and workers into a gig economy by allowing them to hire contractors and avoid the protection afforded to employees. The recent adoption of California Proposition 22 (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22) opens the gate to other companies using independent contractors rather than hiring employees.</p>
<p>Wage stagnation would not be a critical issue if prices had risen at the same rate as inflation, but that hasn't been the case. Health premiums rose 3% above inflation every year over 10 years, according to a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation survey (https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.1001?utm_campaign=HASU%3A+10-05-18+%28Copy%29&utm_medium=email&vgo_ee=TQLYTaMUxLuVgns98nuK7Q%3D%3D&utm_content=Health+Affairs++October+Issue%3A+Social+Determinants%2C+Drug+++Device+Prices+++More%3B+2018+Costs+For+Employer-Sponsored+Family+Health+Coverage%3B+Aftermath+Of+A+School+Shooting&utm_source=Newsletter&). That is not taking into account the independent contractors who would have to pay out of pocket often at a much higher premium than when working as an employee.</p>
<p>The average annual cost for tuition, room and board at a four-year institution (http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76) rose from $16,590 in 1995 (in 2017 dollars) to $27,357 in 2017 a 2.3% annual increase above inflation. Median house prices have gone from $200,000 to $300,000 over the same period. That's a 1.8% increase on top of inflation. We are seeing similar trends in prices for child-car, gas, and cars all have drastically increased since 1990, while wages have practically stayed the same.</p>
<p>Creating a new dream
Not all hope is lost, however. Whereas previous generations could be complacent about their future, today's millennials and younger generations must take a more proactive approach to secure their dreams. As mentioned above, this requires a shift in mindset. Instead of focusing just on maintaining a 9-to-5 job and saving up for retirement, it would be wise to build passive income. Passive income can help you not just maintain your wealth but also continue to grow it and save toward your future.</p>
<p>There are many ways to earn passive income. My personal expertise is in turnkey rentals (http://marteleric.com/). Owning a turnkey single-family rental is a great, fast way to earn passive income while working or during retirement. Investing in a turnkey property means you buy a rental home or apartment that has already been fixed up and rented through a property management company. You buy it, managers run it, and you collect the profits.</p>
<p>The American dream is still alive. It just requires a shift in mindset and a more proactive approach. Whereas previous generations could be more complacent about their future, today you must take action or your standard of living could easily slide toward poverty. Acquiring passive income is the surest way to secure your future success.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education</p>
<p>Socrates is on trial… again. In fact, a growing chorus of voices is arguing that reverence to the classics is not only flawed, but also enmeshed with long-standing power imbalances. Princeton University said its “own department bears witness to the place of Classics in the long arc of systemic racism.” Others claim that such literature has been historically weaponized to justify systems of control, often to the exclusion and oppression of non-white and non-European cultures. At very least, these works should be incorporated within a broader diversity of literature, if not stricken from the required readings altogether. Still others express caution. The study of Plato, Homer, and Aristotle, they contend, engenders just the sort of critical thinking universities are meant to foster.

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education</p>
<p>Socrates is on trial… again. In fact, a growing chorus of voices is arguing that reverence to the classics is not only flawed, but also enmeshed with long-standing power imbalances. Princeton University said its “own department bears witness to the place of Classics in the long arc of systemic racism.” Others claim that such literature has been historically weaponized to justify systems of control, often to the exclusion and oppression of non-white and non-European cultures. At very least, these works should be incorporated within a broader diversity of literature, if not stricken from the required readings altogether. Still others express caution. The study of Plato, Homer, and Aristotle, they contend, engenders just the sort of critical thinking universities are meant to foster. Inspiration, they add, can be found from a variety of sources, and not just from figures who bear physical resemblance to those who are inspired. In fact, celebrated African American authors, such as Toni Morrison, studied the classics, and drew empowerment from them. Furthermore, they argue, underprivileged students indeed benefit from understanding the very literature that influences the society in which they live. In this context, we debate the following question: Are the Classics Overrated?

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Education, World</p>
<p>For nearly three-quarters of a century, Queen Elizabeth II sat on high as Britain’s monarch. With her death, however, new political momentum is building that casts fresh doubts about the future of the British Crown. Several former British colonies, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Jamaica, have debated severing ties, while Republican campaigners in Britain now see opportunity to reassess what it means to have a monarchy without offending a popular queen. King Charles III is far less beloved. And after 1,200 years, the throne to which he has ascended is more uncertain now than at any time in recent memory. The question of the monarchy’s relevance, as such, has reemerged in the public spotlight. Those who argue in favor of it say constitutional monarchies serve a moderating force in national politics, support minority interests, and provide continuity in leadership. It is human nature, they say, to have a single leader at the helm, no matter how ceremonial. Those against it point to the legacy of Britain’s checkered colonial past, claims of corruption and misuse of taxpayer funds, and persistent scandal. Against that backdrop, we debate the longevity of the British monarchy.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Science, Tech</p>
<p>For decades, scientists around the world have dedicated their lives — and research dollars — to one question: Is there anyone else out there? In the early 1970s, NASA joined the hunt with its own program to search for extraterrestrial life, or SETI for short. When that was defunded by Congress, private efforts took hold. But just what have decades of SETI brought us? And how should we approach the search in those to come? For SETI’s supporters, finding other intelligent life in the cosmos is a fundamentally human endeavor. It probes our understanding of the cosmos, what it means to live and survive on Earth and beyond, and just where our species fits into the greater universe. But others warn that SETI is a distraction from other scientific endeavors that, at best, diverts critical resources and, at worst, will open a can of worms humanity isn’t ready to deal with. Just what would happen if we actually find other beings? Are we mature enough as a society to respond? In this episode, we ask the essential extraterrestrial question: to search or not to search?</p>

<p>Debates. You remember them. When both sides presented facts to support their chosen position. While debate has disappeared from much of our daily social interaction — replaced by conspiracy theories, demagoguery, and “Facebook” factoids — some institutions still attempt to exercise their intellect and deductive abilities via debate forums. Open to Debates is one such organization.</p>
<p>The most recent two episodes of debate podcast Open to Debate discusses futurist topics that may seem like science fiction, but could become nonfiction before long. They ask the questions “Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?” and “Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?”</p>
<p>In each debate, one expert argues yes and one argues no.</p>
<p>In this latest episode, “Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?” episode, astronomer and SETI Institute co-founder Jill Tarter argues yes. Theoretical cosmologist and Science Channel host Paul Sutter argues no.</p>
<p>In last week’s “Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?” episode, MIT economics professor Daron Acemoglu argues yes. Artificial intelligence and robotics researcher Darrell West argues no.</p>

<p>Remember that one crackpot theory of election fraud is that votes for Trump were beamed to a satellite orbiting the earth, and those votes were changed for Biden.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Science, Tech</p>
<p>For decades, scientists around the world have dedicated their lives — and research dollars — to one question: Is there anyone else out there? In the early 1970s, NASA joined the hunt with its own program to search for extraterrestrial life, or SETI for short. When that was defunded by Congress, private efforts took hold. But just what have decades of SETI brought us? And how should we approach the search in those to come? For SETI’s supporters, finding other intelligent life in the cosmos is a fundamentally human endeavor. It probes our understanding of the cosmos, what it means to live and survive on Earth and beyond, and just where our species fits into the greater universe. But others warn that SETI is a distraction from other scientific endeavors that, at best, diverts critical resources and, at worst, will open a can of worms humanity isn’t ready to deal with. Just what would happen if we actually find other beings? Are we mature enough as a society to respond? In this episode, we ask the essential extraterrestrial question: to search or not to search?</p>

<p>Is it true that artificial intelligence will do more harm than good? Proponents say it will help us solve problems like climate change and world hunger while eliminating dangerous and mundane jobs. But critics warn that A.I.’s current trajectory is a dangerous one, which will likely concentrate power, reduce jobs, surveil consumers and voters alike, and threaten democracy. What’s more, some people say these conditions are not based on science fiction but are already in the process of afflicting us, given the number of algorithms we engage with on a daily basis. So, could artificial intelligence be used to help solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges and level the playing field, or will it present perils that far outweigh any good it might do?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Education, U.S.</p>
<p>Last year, only 1.5 million high school students took the SAT, down from 2.2 million in the class of 2020. Covid-19 played a big role in the decision among many schools not to move forward with at-home testing. But the move sparked an even wider discussion about the test itself. Currently, at least 75% of colleges actually don’t require the SAT or ACT. That’s an all-time high, with many schools pledging not to return to it. But is that the right move? Proponents call into question the efficacy and inequity of standardized tests, pointing to high-profile college admission scandals, as well as those leveraging access to resources to net higher scores. They argue a more expansive approach to admissions is better suited in selecting students. Those who defend the SAT, however, say the test presents opportunities for smart under-resourced students to get into top schools. Removing such tests could actually make present inequities worse. Additionally, the focus should be on addressing the achievement gap, rather than merely changing the way students are evaluated. Personal essays, GPA, extra curricula, they say, are just as easy to game with financial privilege. So in this context, we ask: Should the SAT be erased?</p>

<div><strong>Pompeo vs. Weingarten: The Way Forward</strong> <small>2023-02-07 19:56:16</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>How Mike Pompeo might get the American Federation of Teachers president to debate him.</p>
<p>We live in an age where hyperbole thrives. “Trump is a Nazi!” and “The January 6 attack on the Capitol was an insurrection!” are but two of the myriad over-the-top accusations that permeate our media and culture these days. Now, we can add a new bit of shrill distortion to the list. On November 21, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to Randi Weingarten (https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2022/mike-pompeo-2024-trump), longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, as “the most dangerous person in the world.”</p>
<p>“I tell the story often I get asked Who’s the most dangerous person in the world? Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping? Pompeo said in an interview with Semafor. “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teacher’s unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”</p>
<p>While there is a kernel truth in Pompeo’s hype, Weingarten is far from the “most dangerous.” First, the great majority of teachers’ union evil is done on the state and local level and does not involve the national organization at all. Additionally, Weingarten has her job because teachers whether because they agree with her positions or because of apathy or fear of speaking out elect to keep her around. Also worth noting is that the AFT does not wield as much power as the other national teachers union, the National Education Association.</p>
<p>After the story received some media play, Pompeo wrote an op-ed for the New York Post on November 29 in which he did something more sensible: he challenged Weingarten to a debate (https://nypost.com/2022/11/29/pompeo-yes-randi-weingarten-is-the-most-dangerous-person-in-america-heres-why/).</p>
<p>Three days later Weingarten declined the offer, and instead made a counterproposal (https://nypost.com/2022/12/02/randi-weingarten-debate-no-mike-pompeo-tour-a-school-with-me-and-see-what-teachers-really-do/). “If he wants to engage in a real discussion about how best to strengthen public education or the importance of treating educators with respect, I invite him to join me in a visit to one of America’s 100,000 public schools to learn a thing or two.”</p>
<p>If I had Pompeo’s ear, I would give him the following advice: Apologize for the hyperbolic comment and take Weingarten up on her offer to visit a school on the condition that she would then debate you. But after the apology, if she refuses to debate Pompeo or anyone else, it may be because of an unpleasant experience she had some years back.</p>
<p>As one who had regularly butted heads with teacher unions at the time, I was pleasantly surprised to get a call in 2010 inviting me to come to New York City to participate in a debate on March 16. Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosts monthly Oxford-style debates on a wide range of topics, and this one was clumsily named, “Do Not Blame the Teachers Unions for Our Failing Schools.” In other words, if you think the unions are to blame, you would vote against the motion.</p>
<p>Each of the 500 or so attendees got to enter their pre-debate opinion electronically before the debate and then voted again once it was over. The winner was determined by the team that got the most people to change their vote.</p>
<p>Our team consisted of Rod Paige, former U.S. Secretary of Education, Terry Moe, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and me, a recently retired middle school teacher.</p>
<p>On the opposing side, there was Kate McLaughlin, a teacher from Massachusetts, Gary Smuts, a superintendent of a school district in southern California, and Randi Weingarten.</p>
<p>Kate and Gary seemed like nice folks who shared a few stories and were very earnest. They sounded silly a couple of times, but nothing they said was too egregious. And then there was Weingarten. It boggles the mind that the best this union leader could do was trot out shibboleths followed by half-truths, which preceded rambling non-sequiturs.</p>
<p>All we had to do was remind the other team of the facts. We used logic, data, and dramatic real-world examples, all the while focusing on the big picture. While I was anticipating some brilliant points or arcane facts that our team wouldn’t be able to handle, the debate never came close to that scenario.</p>
<p>The results were definitive, to say the least. Despite our fears of an audience packed with unionists, the pro-union side got clobbered. About 95 percent of the people who changed their votes came over to the anti-union side.</p>
<p>I saw up close and personal what I have always felt that the teacher unions are running on empty. The emperor is naked as a jaybird. Not only don’t they have anything to offer in the way of true education reform, but they are the greatest impediment we have to any meaningful change. All the lofty words from teacher union presidents over the years about higher quality schools, teacher accountability, putting the interests of students first, etc. are nothing but empty rhetoric meant to lead the public to believe that children are their highest priority.</p>

<div><strong>Student Debt Forgiveness Folly</strong> <small>2023-02-07 22:41:30</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>In this week's The Reason Roundtable, editors Matt Welch, (https://reason.com/people/matt-welch/) Peter Suderman (https://reason.com/people/peter-suderman/), and Nick Gillespie (https://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie/) are joined by Associate Editor Liz Wolfe (https://reason.com/people/liz-wolfe/) as they criticize President Joe Biden's recently announced student loan forgiveness program.</p>
<p>2:07: Biden's executive order to cancel student debt.</p>
<p>29:33: Weekly Listener Question:</p>
<p>Why is the abortion debate within libertarianism treated so dismissively by everyone on The Reason Roundtable? Most other topics are approached with an evenhandedness that attempts to at least acknowledge that those who disagree with the panelists are doing so in good faith and are at least attempting to be reasonable. It's not surprising that everyone on The Roundtable is pro-choice. But why can't you all acknowledge your disagreement with pro-life libertarians is over fundamental values that libertarianism can't resolve? The way you approach the subject makes your own colleagues like Liz Wolfe into pariah libertarians who have no place in the movement. Pro-life libertarians begin with the premise that life starts at conception and that all humans have human rights. Further, in this line of thinking, the most foundational right (if any rights exist at all) is the right to not be killed without just cause. And so we conclude that the right of a baby to not be killed outweighs a woman's right to not be pregnant or not to provide the sustenance a growing baby needs to live in her womb. It is perfectly rational for someone else to say that he values a woman's autonomy more than the rights of a potential human life (or even an actual human life), but these two positions are irreconcilable. Why does everyone on The Roundtable go around masquerading as if their position on abortion is based on pure reason and science and the only acceptable libertarian position instead of acknowledging that it really boils down to values and you don't value a baby's life before she is born more than the mother's autonomy?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> August 26, 2022</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Education, U.S.</p>
<p>Last year, only 1.5 million high school students took the SAT, down from 2.2 million in the class of 2020. Covid-19 played a big role in the decision among many schools not to move forward with at-home testing. But the move sparked an even wider discussion about the test itself. Currently, at least 75% of colleges actually don’t require the SAT or ACT. That’s an all-time high, with many schools pledging not to return to it. But is that the right move? Proponents call into question the efficacy and inequity of standardized tests, pointing to high-profile college admission scandals, as well as those leveraging access to resources to net higher scores. They argue a more expansive approach to admissions is better suited in selecting students. Those who defend the SAT, however, say the test presents opportunities for smart under-resourced students to get into top schools. Removing such tests could actually make present inequities worse. Additionally, the focus should be on addressing the achievement gap, rather than merely changing the way students are evaluated. Personal essays, GPA, extra curricula, they say, are just as easy to game with financial privilege. So in this context, we ask: Should the SAT be erased?</p>

<p>After a series of prime-time hearings from the January 6th Committee and hundreds of charges against individuals who participated in the events of that day, the Department of Justice faces a complex political and legal question: Should it charge Donald Trump with federal crimes? Those calling on Attorney General Merrick Garland to act argue that no person is above the law and that the Committee's investigations have unearthed more than enough evidence to bring a variety of charges against the former president. But still others warn that indicting a former president — who has signaled interest in returning to the campaign trail in 2024— and who enjoys considerable support in the Republican party will even further fraction the nation's political divisions. Would indicting President Trump set a dangerous precedent and deepen political hostility in the run-up to a major presidential election? Or would failing to indict him prove even worse?</p>

<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer. As we now know, the inspector general of the State Department did not find she had violated any criminal laws and FBI Director James Comey – no Hillary Clinton fan – agreed that not one of the 33,000 emails she transferred to her private server contained recognizable classified markings.</p>
<p>But that example cuts both ways. Yes, it is obviously hypocritical for Trump and his supporters to scream about due process in the Colorado case. But Mrs. Clinton’s example also shows why due process is so important. She was never convicted of anything. And, so far at least, neither has Trump.</p>
<p>Winning a criminal insurrection conspiracy case won’t be a cakewalk for Special Counsel Jack Smith. I say this because on Dec. 14 I participated as playing Smith’s role as “prosecutor” in a mock trial sponsored by the nationally respected nonprofit organization Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/). Our mock argument was live-streamed last week, but it can be heard again on Jan. 5, 2024, the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection effort, on an NPR local affiliate; seen and heard on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AQxFtqh-4); on opentodebate.org; or on available podcast channels.</p>
<p>During this mock trial, the Trump side was represented by Sara Azari (https://www.azarilaw.com/sara-azari), a Los Angeles-based defense lawyer. Sara argued not only the absence of a smoking gun admission or written evidence by Trump that he knew he had lost the election; she also effectively argued that Trump’s claims, though false, are protected as political speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>My response was that the First Amendment does not protect lies that are part of a criminal conspiracy. I pointed out that there will be testimony from several people that Trump admitted he had lost but lied about it. However, I also pointed out that a jury can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the voter fraud did not cost him the election because the highest officials of his government, whom he appointed, all told him he had lost, including the attorney general, senior Justice Department officials, the director of national intelligence, and every single state official in the key battleground states whom he called. Georgia’s secretary of state of told him he had lost after three separate recounts. Still Trump asked him to “find” one vote more than the total Biden was found to have won Georgia – proving he knew he was asking the secretary of state to lie.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that 61 out of 61 state court judges rejected his claim that he had lost these key battleground states because of voter fraud. (Once in Pennsylvania, a court found some voter fraud, but that judge also ruled it wasn’t significant enough to change the outcome in that state).</p>
<p>In any event, there will and must be a test of Donald Trump’s culpability, but that must come in a trial, with due process by a finder of fact that reaches a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. America cannot accept a verdict barring Trump from running for office based on a court hearing 1,500 miles from Washington, D.C., without a trial, on a civil court standard of “preponderance of the evidence” – meaning anything above 50%.</p>
<p>Those of us who oppose Trump can beat him at the ballot box, especially if and when he is convicted of felonies in one or more of the criminal trials he faces in federal and state courts. Colorado’s chief justice was right in his dissent when he concluded Trump should not be barred by a state court “in the absence of an insurrection-related conviction” – the latter word meaning after a trial and a jury of his peers finds the defendant guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>

<p>After a series of prime-time hearings from the January 6th Committee and hundreds of charges against individuals who participated in the events of that day, the Department of Justice faces a complex political and legal question: Should it charge Donald Trump with federal crimes? Those calling on Attorney General Merrick Garland to act argue that no person is above the law and that the Committee's investigations have unearthed more than enough evidence to bring a variety of charges against the former president. But still others warn that indicting a former president — who has signaled interest in returning to the campaign trail in 2024— and who enjoys considerable support in the Republican party will even further fraction the nation's political divisions. Would indicting President Trump set a dangerous precedent and deepen political hostility in the run-up to a major presidential election? Or would failing to indict him prove even worse?</p>

<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer.

<p>For more than six decades, Henry Kissinger has been a force in international affairs. Arguably among the most recognizable of U.S. diplomats, he served as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor to Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. That, however, is but a snap-shot of his true power and influence. Considered a scholar of diplomacy and a prolific writer, Kissinger consulted on security matters for much of the 20th and 21st centuries, advising presidents ranging from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Donald Trump. Informed, perhaps, by his own childhood in Nazi Germany, the subsequent career that took to him to the centers of power is both celebrated and the subject of controversy.
In a special Open to Debate collaboration with <a href="https://howtoacademy.com/events/leadership-six-studies-in-world-strategy/">How To Academy</a>, the United Kingdom’s leading thought leadership platform, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait sits down with Henry Kissinger to discuss his life, his perspective, his public experience, and how they each relate to modern leadership in this fast-changing world.</p>

<p>At the time Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Russia supplied the European Union with some 40% of its natural gas, 25% of its oil, and nearly half of its coal. But as punishment for the war, most of Russia’s energy imports to Europe will be banned by the end of the year, along with sweeping sanctions that target banks, businesses, and oligarchs. Is that smart policy? Those who argue “yes” say Russia must be punished for its actions, democratic governments should be protected, and that accommodations only embolden Moscow. Those who argue “no” say isolating the Kremlin to this extent is a dangerous gamble, which could undermine Europe’s economies, push Russia further toward China, and lay the groundwork for an escalation. In this context, and in partnership with the German Marshall Fund, we debate this question, "Should we isolate Russia?"

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Finance, U.S.</p>
<p>The Fed recently announced aggressive interest rate hikes and is signaling more to come. Its goal? To stabilize the economy amid surging inflation (reaching rates not seen in some 40 years) and lingering supply chain disruptions and shortages. But just what can the Fed actually do to stave off a potential recession? While many are calling on the central bank to use its monetary policy tools to quell consumer demand and help stabilize the economy, others warn that higher interest rates will backfire and end up hurting the nation's most vulnerable. In this episode, two esteemed economists debate the Fed's role in the modern economy, the potential for a "soft landing," and the policy choices that will shape our economy in the months ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Health, U.S.</p>
<p>Processed food is bad for you, right? Well, there’s more to this story. As new technologies create foods that can’t be made in home kitchens, such as plant-based meats and dairy products made with plant proteins, the question of whether we should all be consuming more highly processed foods is up for debate. Advocates say a substantial increase in food processing is the best way to feed growing human populations while also reducing food waste. We should trust – and invest – in food technology that can make our global food supply healthier and more sustainable, including highly or ultra-processed foods. Opponents argue that these kinds of foods are often less nutritious, and are commonly linked to adverse health indices, particularly when it comes to ultra-processing. As this debate blooms, Open to Debate partners with the Institute of Food Technologists to debate this question: Should We Eat More Processed Foods?

<div><strong>Science communication is key to public acceptance, innovation</strong> <small>2023-02-07 20:33:46</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Nov. 26 ATHENS Genetic improvement, particularly improvements related to animal production, has been one of the most transformational agricultural advancements in our history.</p>
<p>The breeding of healthier, more productive livestock has been achieved through genetic selection over the course of time, both through natural genetic selection and through increased use of artificial insemination, particularly in poultry and cattle production. These advancements have increased production levels dramatically: For example, there were approximately 26 million dairy cattle producing milk in the U.S. in 1950, but through genetic selection, this number dropped to approximately 9 million dairy cattle in 2010, all while milk production increased and production costs decreased.</p>
<p>Increases in efficiency driven by technological advancements that have been widely adopted by industry have created a more stable agricultural system worldwide.</p>
<p>What if we had not been able to make these improvements because the public was not in favor of genetic selection? said Alison Van Eenennaam, professor of cooperative extension at the University of California, Davis, the guest speaker for the 2022 D.W. Brooks Lecture held Nov. 8.</p>
<p>Using the complicated past of genetically modified organisms and the rich history of agricultural innovation as examples, Van Eenennaam made a compelling case for the increased use of thoughtful, direct science communication that seeks to explain the why behind the technological advancements that are designed to feed a growing world population.</p>
<p>Agricultural innovations are not always accepted with open arms, however. GMOs — for some, the darling of agricultural advancement, and for others, the villain have suffered in the court of public opinion, much to the dismay of agricultural scientists in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
<p>A respected member of the agricultural and scientific community, Van Eenennaam has appeared on national television and in debate series, such as the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. in New York City, as an advocate for the use of GMOs, which have been shown to be a safe, sustainable option to increase food production.</p>
<p>Although she has done extensive work in GMO advocacy, Van Eenennaam's own research centers on a different topic entirely: genome editing. A relatively new and novel technology, genome editing seeks to adjust the DNA of organisms in order to select desirable traits that improve performance and health. Her current work seeks to use genome editing to increase the prevalence of cattle born without horns.</p>
<p>Similar to her efforts to communicate the facts about GMOs, Van Eenennaam has gone to great lengths to communicate her own research in a way that makes the purpose of genome editing understandable. Most notably, Van Eenennaam, along with one of her genome-editing success stories, Cosmo, worked with PBS Nova to showcase this advancement in agricultural technology.</p>
<p>To me, this project combined all the elements of science communication, Van Eenennaam said of the documentary. It doesn't touch on the how hardly at all it touches on the why and does it in an engaging style that is ... comprehensible by the general public."</p>
<p>Innovation enables us to produce more food with fewer resources, breed the most efficient livestock, and even cure diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In order to find success in these areas and more, we must be willing to adopt the technologies that enable a more efficient path toward that success. Innovation is the driving force behind societal advancement, Van Eenennaam said.</p>
<p>I hope that we can engage narrative storytellers or else develop that technology and skill ourselves to tell a story around genome editing, be it for plants or animals so that we're actually able to use that in future breeding programs, she said. I hope I've shown you that the opportunity cost of not adopting innovation is very real and not always very obvious. Not being able to use improved breeding techniques would have very big environmental and food security consequences.</p>
<p>The 2022 D.W. Brooks Faculty Awards for Excellence also were recognized at the lecture, which is held annually in honor of the late D.W. Brooks, a Georgian who dedicated his life to the advancement of agriculture in our state and across the world.</p>

<div class='news-content'><p>Is the Truth really out there?
Debates. You remember them. When both sides presented facts to support your chosen position. While the debate has disappeared from much of our daily social interaction replaced by conspiracy theories, demagoguery, and "Facebook" factoids some institutions still attempt to exercise their intellect and deductive abilities via debate forums. Open to Debate is one such organization.</p>
<p>The most recent two episodes of the debate podcast Open to Debate (formerly, Intelligence Squared U.S.) discuss futurist topics that may seem like science fiction but could become nonfiction before long. They ask the questions "Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?" (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-we-search-for-extraterrestrial-life/#/) and "Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?" (https://opentodebate.org/debate/agree-to-disagree-will-artificial-intelligence-do-more-harm-than-good/#/)
In each debate, one expert argues yes and one argues no.
In this latest episode, "Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?" episode, astronomer and SETI Institute co-founder Jill Tarter argues yes. Theoretical cosmologist and Science Channel host Paul Sutter argues no.
In last week's "Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?" episode, MIT economics professor Daron Acemoglu argues yes. Artificial intelligence and robotics researcher Darrell West argues no.
Listen to both episodes at https://smarturl.it/iq2podcast (https://smarturl.it/iq2podcast) or wherever you get podcasts.</p>
<p>Remember that one crackpot theory of election fraud is that votes for Trump were beamed to a satellite orbiting the earth, and those votes were changed for Biden. Could it be possible that the beam of votes was intercepted by an alien species and switched to Biden because aliens are "groomers" and wanted to visit pedophile pizza places run exclusively by Democrats? It's possible.</p>

<p>The most recent two episodes of the debate podcast Open to Debate (formerly, Intelligence Squared U.S.) discuss futurist topics that may seem like science fiction but could become nonfiction before long. They ask the questions "Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?" (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-we-search-for-extraterrestrial-life/#/) and "Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?" (https://opentodebate.org/debate/agree-to-disagree-will-artificial-intelligence-do-more-harm-than-good/#/)
In each debate, one expert argues yes and one argues no.
In this latest episode, "Should We Search for Extraterrestrial Life?" episode, astronomer and SETI Institute co-founder Jill Tarter argues yes. Theoretical cosmologist and Science Channel host Paul Sutter argues no.
In last week's "Will Artificial Intelligence Do More Harm Than Good?" episode, MIT economics professor Daron Acemoglu argues yes. Artificial intelligence and robotics researcher Darrell West argues no.
Listen to both episodes at https://smarturl.it/iq2podcast (https://smarturl.it/iq2podcast) or wherever you get podcasts.</p>
<p>Remember that one crackpot theory of election fraud is that votes for Trump were beamed to a satellite orbiting the earth, and those votes were changed for Biden. Could it be possible that the beam of votes was intercepted by an alien species and switched to Biden because aliens are "groomers" and wanted to visit pedophile pizza places run exclusively by Democrats? It's possible.</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Energy</p>
<p>The dangers of climate change are “no longer over the horizon.” Humanity may soon pass the “point of no return.” These are the phrases U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres used to describe what he called an “utterly inadequate” global response to rising temperatures. In fact, world leaders and environmental advocates have long demanded structural overhauls to the way we consume and produce. Standing in the way, Guterres noted, is a sheer lack of will. But if we were to decisively act, and restructure our global economy with the climate in mind, who would shoulder the burden? Is it actually feasible? Assuming finite resources, where does climate change rank in the pecking order of global problems? Or should our collective focus orient more toward human capacity for adaptation? In this timely debate, Intelligence Squared and the Richmond Forum convene four leading global thinkers on climate science, geopolitics, and international economics to take on this question: Can humans adapt to climate change?
This debate took place in front of a live audience in partnership with the Richmond Forum on April 30, 2022.</p>

<p>Tesla vehicle sales are, well … electric. The company posted $5.5 billion in 2021 profits,  roughly six times its previous year earnings. Globally, the electric car industry is anything but static, soaring to 7 million units in 2021. The promise of owning such a green vehicle – and doing your part for the planet – is a big part of the lure. But is it warranted? Devonshire Research Group, an investment firm that values tech companies, examined each stage of environmental impact it takes to produce an electric car. It found that while a Tesla might not belch out exhaust, there are other potentially equally damaging effects wrought along the way. EV advocates argue that while the technology and resources aren’t perfect, they are ultimately better for the environment long term as the tech improves, and are far more realistic in application than mass transit systems, particularly for rural areas. Opponents say the kinds of infrastructure EVs require, such as nation-wide charging stations, still require huge investments that would be better suited for more ecologically-friendly mass transit systems. So, does your electric vehicle help the planet?</p>

<p>In a modern-day battle of David and Goliath on Wall Street, thousands of amateur retail investors banded together to bid up stocks in a handful of failing companies, most notably the nostalgic video game hub known as GameStop. Within days, the renegade traders sent stocks soaring and dealt heavy blows to hedge funds and other traditional professional investors who had bet against the companies. The "meme stock" phenomenon was born. But where does "revolution" stand a year later? Did the amateurs—trading mostly on the Robinhood platform—change the world of finance? Should more "ordinary" investors get into the game? Or will that benefit Wall Street at the little guy's expense?</p>

<p>In a modern-day battle of David and Goliath on Wall Street, thousands of amateur retail investors banded together to bid up stocks in a handful of failing companies, most notably the nostalgic video game hub known as GameStop. Within days, the renegade traders sent stocks soaring and dealt heavy blows to hedge funds and other traditional professional investors who had bet against the companies. The "meme stock" phenomenon was born. But where does "revolution" stand a year later? Did the amateurs—trading mostly on the Robinhood platform—change the world of finance? Should more "ordinary" investors get into the game? Or will that benefit Wall Street at the little guy's expense?</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is poised to make a decision so controversial that even a leaked draft majority opinion can send shockwaves across the nation. In 98-pages, Justice Alito decried Roe v. Wade as “egregiously wrong from the start," declared no right to abortion can be found in the Constitution, and sent abortion laws back to the states — about half of which have "trigger laws" that will ban abortion almost immediately upon Roe's demise. Exactly how likely is this draft opinion to become the law of the land? What would overturning such a landmark ruling mean for the Court as an institution? And are the Justices ultimately correct in holding that Roe was simply wrong?
Against the backdrop of divisive media coverage and partisan sensationalism one of the nation's most polarizing topics, we're doing what we do best: In this Open to Debate "pop-up" debate, we bring two of the nation's most esteemed legal scholars to the table for a civil, thoughtful debate on the merits of whether it’s right to end Roe.</p>

<p>New York. Los Angeles. Boston. San Francisco. Call them America's "superstars." With mega populations, these urban hubs have long reigned as the nation's economic, social, and cultural capitals. But big cities have also been the hardest hit by the pandemic. "Zoom towns" are springing up across the country as professionals leave the city in droves. Even more, the pandemic has brought economic and social inequality into sharp focus for the nation's lawmakers. And some, particularly in large cities that boast the most obvious cases of such inequality, are enacting new progressive policies and laws that seek to combat inequality. For some, this means a new financial structure that makes city life less compelling for those in higher income brackets. Will megacities keep their magnetism in the wake of Covid-19? Or are their best days behind them?</p>

<div><strong>De Blasio’s Victory in New York vs. Florida Debate Is a Wake-Up Call for Conservatives</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:24:53</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>‘Florida is choosing the path of burning books,’ the ex-mayor says in painting the Sunshine State as a MAGA-fueled dystopia.</p>
<p>On April 28, a debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) between the Democratic former mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, and the Manhattan Institute’s president, Reihan Salam, will be released. Having watched the taping, I can say it’s a much-watch for liberals and conservatives alike for very different reasons.</p>
<p>I expected Mr. DeBlasio, with a governing record to defend, to be the underdog on the question, “Is Florida Eating New York’s Lunch?” The more than 1.6 million former New Yorkers who now call the Sunshine State home would seem to disprove his side of the argument.</p>
<p>The Census shows more New Yorkers relocated to Florida in 2022 than in any year since it joined the union in 1845. New York also has, at almost 10 percent, the highest income tax in the nation, while Florida has none.</p>
<p>The facts, figures, and comparisons of legal and regulatory climates all favored Mr. Salam, so liberals will enjoy seeing Mr. De Blasio prevail. Still, conservatives would do well to watch, not to suffer, but to see just what they’re up against in the arena of ideas.</p>
<p>The debate to be shared on public radio, video, and the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast was hosted by the non-partisan Open to Debate group, whose mission is to address “the extreme polarization of our nation and our politics.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salam, like many on the right, seemed to interpret avoiding “extreme polarization” as refusing to punch or even block. This posture was striking since he used to be the executive editor of William F. Buckley’s National Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley earned universal praise for his geniality yet never let anyone run roughshod over him. Even when confronting radicals and racists as the host of “Firing Line,” he never showed his belly, marshaling intelligence and humor to lay out the strongest possible case.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio, too, has core beliefs. He was unafraid to launch haymakers and score some hits below the belt. Even when the moderator, John Donvan, stepped in to defend Mr. Salam, the mayor would go right on flogging straw dogs.</p>
<p>Like “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” from the Jim Croce song, Mr. De Blasio concealed a razor in his shoe and used it to carve up Mr. Salam with such skill, that the man seemed not to notice until he grew woozy.</p>
<p>It was like watching a pitcher on a team I don’t root for throw a perfect game. “Why can’t our guy whip a fastball like that?” Mr. De Blasio pulled off the upset because while Mr. Salam aimed for viewers’ brains, Mr. De Blasio zeroed in on their hearts, painting Florida as an intolerant, dystopian hellscape dominated by “MAGA extremism.”</p>
<p>Florida is choosing a path of banning books, Mr. De Blasio said, and disallowing a woman’s right to choose. Florida’s turning against trans youth. Despite the state having larger black and Hispanic populations, he said it was hostile to diversity.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also warned as the Democratic senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did in 1969 that Florida would soon be underwater due to greenhouse gas, and heralded the Empire State’s social spending while sidestepping that its unsustainable deficit is the nation’s largest.</p>
<p>When I factor in pre-K for my child, Mr. De Blasio said, quoting a new arrival from Seattle, my cost of living is actually cheaper. I could almost hear the picture of Thomas Sowell in the book behind Mr. Salam screaming that this is tempting people to New York on the promise the state will give them cash stolen from their neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also touted his city’s rent control and $15 minimum wage. Conservatives used to have answers for these subjects: If rent control works, why does Gotham have the highest rent in the country? What about the minimum wage pricing out entry-level jobs, etc.?</p>
<p>The left ought to watch this debate to exalt victory and the right to relearn the lesson of the 2022 midterms that statistics won’t win elections for them, and until they learn to wield the rhetorical razor once more, the left is going to go right on charging lunch to their tabs.</p></div>
<div><strong>De Blasio slams Florida in online debate</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:35:32</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>'The future unfortunately is not bright for Florida' the former mayor said, regarding climate change.
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disavowed Marxism Friday afternoon, declaring that New York City’s inclusive politics far outweighed whatever advantages of climate or affordability the state of Florida may have. Unless you happen to take a Marxian perspective here, you can’t just talk about economics. You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well,” he said. “Florida has some strengths. But Florida is rapidly and aggressively undermining those strengths.”</p>
<p>De Blasio put himself in the debate chair to defend his city on a livestream (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to civil discourse. He took on Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute on the question: “Is Florida eating New York’s lunch?”</p>
<p>Now a visiting professor (https://nyunews.com/news/2023/04/11/bill-de-blasio-speaks-at-wagner/) at NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, de Blasio sat there while Salam slammed him, indirectly, on the city’s cost of living, ability to educate its students, retain public employees including police and teachers, and argued that working class people were leaving in search of affordability.</p>
<p>De Blasio, in turn, criticized Florida’s politics, including Gov. Ron DeSantis’ law banning abortion (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/13/florida-6-week-abortion-ban-bill-00091965) after six weeks and the “Don’t Say Gay” law. (https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d) The current mayor, Eric Adams, has found DeSantis’ conservative politics to be an easy target too, and backed an ad campaign (https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/04/nyc-fires-back-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-billboard-counter-attack/363992/) telling LGTBQ Floridians and their allies to come to New York.</p>

But the threat from mother nature is so much greater.”</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics</p>
<p>New York. Los Angeles. Boston. San Francisco. Call them America's "superstars." With mega populations, these urban hubs have long reigned as the nation's economic, social, and cultural capitals. But big cities have also been the hardest hit by the pandemic. "Zoom towns" are springing up across the country as professionals leave the city in droves. Even more, the pandemic has brought economic and social inequality into sharp focus for the nation's lawmakers. And some, particularly in large cities that boast the most obvious cases of such inequality, are enacting new progressive policies and laws that seek to combat inequality. For some, this means a new financial structure that makes city life less compelling for those in higher income brackets. Will megacities keep their magnetism in the wake of Covid-19? Or are their best days behind them?</p>

<div><strong>De Blasio’s Victory in New York vs. Florida Debate Is a Wake-Up Call for Conservatives</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:24:53</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>‘Florida is choosing the path of burning books,’ the ex-mayor says in painting the Sunshine State as a MAGA-fueled dystopia.</p>
<p>On April 28, a debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) between the Democratic former mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, and the Manhattan Institute’s president, Reihan Salam, will be released. Having watched the taping, I can say it’s a much-watch for liberals and conservatives alike for very different reasons.</p>
<p>I expected Mr. DeBlasio, with a governing record to defend, to be the underdog on the question, “Is Florida Eating New York’s Lunch?” The more than 1.6 million former New Yorkers who now call the Sunshine State home would seem to disprove his side of the argument.</p>
<p>The Census shows more New Yorkers relocated to Florida in 2022 than in any year since it joined the union in 1845. New York also has, at almost 10 percent, the highest income tax in the nation, while Florida has none.</p>
<p>The facts, figures, and comparisons of legal and regulatory climates all favored Mr. Salam, so liberals will enjoy seeing Mr. De Blasio prevail. Still, conservatives would do well to watch, not to suffer, but to see just what they’re up against in the arena of ideas.</p>
<p>The debate to be shared on public radio, video, and the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast was hosted by the non-partisan Open to Debate group, whose mission is to address “the extreme polarization of our nation and our politics.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salam, like many on the right, seemed to interpret avoiding “extreme polarization” as refusing to punch or even block. This posture was striking since he used to be the executive editor of William F. Buckley’s National Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley earned universal praise for his geniality yet never let anyone run roughshod over him. Even when confronting radicals and racists as the host of “Firing Line,” he never showed his belly, marshaling intelligence and humor to lay out the strongest possible case.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio, too, has core beliefs. He was unafraid to launch haymakers and score some hits below the belt. Even when the moderator, John Donvan, stepped in to defend Mr. Salam, the mayor would go right on flogging straw dogs.</p>
<p>Like “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” from the Jim Croce song, Mr. De Blasio concealed a razor in his shoe and used it to carve up Mr. Salam with such skill, that the man seemed not to notice until he grew woozy.</p>
<p>It was like watching a pitcher on a team I don’t root for throw a perfect game. “Why can’t our guy whip a fastball like that?” Mr. De Blasio pulled off the upset because while Mr. Salam aimed for viewers’ brains, Mr. De Blasio zeroed in on their hearts, painting Florida as an intolerant, dystopian hellscape dominated by “MAGA extremism.”</p>
<p>Florida is choosing a path of banning books, Mr. De Blasio said, and disallowing a woman’s right to choose. Florida’s turning against trans youth. Despite the state having larger black and Hispanic populations, he said it was hostile to diversity.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also warned as the Democratic senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did in 1969 that Florida would soon be underwater due to greenhouse gas, and heralded the Empire State’s social spending while sidestepping that its unsustainable deficit is the nation’s largest.</p>
<p>When I factor in pre-K for my child, Mr. De Blasio said, quoting a new arrival from Seattle, my cost of living is actually cheaper. I could almost hear the picture of Thomas Sowell in the book behind Mr. Salam screaming that this is tempting people to New York on the promise the state will give them cash stolen from their neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also touted his city’s rent control and $15 minimum wage. Conservatives used to have answers for these subjects: If rent control works, why does Gotham have the highest rent in the country? What about the minimum wage pricing out entry-level jobs, etc.?</p>
<p>The left ought to watch this debate to exalt victory and the right to relearn the lesson of the 2022 midterms that statistics won’t win elections for them, and until they learn to wield the rhetorical razor once more, the left is going to go right on charging lunch to their tabs.</p></div>
<div><strong>De Blasio slams Florida in online debate</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:35:32</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>'The future unfortunately is not bright for Florida' the former mayor said, regarding climate change.
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disavowed Marxism Friday afternoon, declaring that New York City’s inclusive politics far outweighed whatever advantages of climate or affordability the state of Florida may have. Unless you happen to take a Marxian perspective here, you can’t just talk about economics. You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well,” he said. “Florida has some strengths. But Florida is rapidly and aggressively undermining those strengths.”</p>
<p>De Blasio put himself in the debate chair to defend his city on a livestream (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to civil discourse. He took on Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute on the question: “Is Florida eating New York’s lunch?”</p>
<p>Now a visiting professor (https://nyunews.com/news/2023/04/11/bill-de-blasio-speaks-at-wagner/) at NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, de Blasio sat there while Salam slammed him, indirectly, on the city’s cost of living, ability to educate its students, retain public employees including police and teachers, and argued that working class people were leaving in search of affordability.</p>
<p>De Blasio, in turn, criticized Florida’s politics, including Gov. Ron DeSantis’ law banning abortion (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/13/florida-6-week-abortion-ban-bill-00091965) after six weeks and the “Don’t Say Gay” law. (https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d) The current mayor, Eric Adams, has found DeSantis’ conservative politics to be an easy target too, and backed an ad campaign (https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/04/nyc-fires-back-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-billboard-counter-attack/363992/) telling LGTBQ Floridians and their allies to come to New York.</p>
<p>In a somewhat morbid closing argument, de Blasio invoked the threat of climate change to argue that New York will ultimately prevail in the rivalry. “The future, unfortunately, is not bright for Florida,” he said. “The human made threats coming out of their state government are bad enough, and will hinder Florida’s economic and social future. But the threat from mother nature is so much greater.”</p></div>

<p>Is it time to end COVID emergency measures? With President Biden's plan to transition to a new normal, more than 70% of Americans recently polled agree that “we just need to get on with our lives.” Some advocates of the plan say it's long overdue, pointing to the long term consequences of isolation and broader effects lock downs have had on society. Critics argue that both hospitalization and COVID death rates are still high, and that the nature of this virus and its variants is far from endemic.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Science</p>
<p>A genetic disease runs in your family. Your doctor tells you that, should you wish to have a child, that child is likely to also carry the disease. But new gene-editing technology could change your fate. It could ensure that your baby is -- and remains -- healthy. Even more, it could potentially make sure your grandchildren are also free of the disease. What do you do? Now, imagine it's not a rare genetic disorder, but a general illness, or eye color, cognitive ability, or athleticism. Do you opt into this new world of genetically edited humans? And what if it's not just you. What your friends, neighbors, and colleagues are also embracing this genetic revolution? Right now, science doesn't give you that choice. But huge advancements in CRISPR technology are making human gene editing a reality. In fact, in 2018, a Chinese scientist announced the first genetically modified babies; twin girls made to resist HIV, smallpox, and malaria. The promise of this technology is clear. But gene editing is not without its perils. Its critics say the technology is destined to exacerbate inequality, pressure all parents (and nations) into editing their children to stay competitive and meddling with the most basic aspect of our humanity. In this context, we ask the question: Should we use gene editing to make better babies?</p>

<div><strong>Parenting Experts Debate If Parenting Is Simply Overrated</strong> <small>2023-02-07 18:51:28</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The age-old nature v. nurture debate took a different turn a couple of months ago during a live debate held at New York City’s Kaye Playhouse and live streamed before becoming part of a syndicated public radio show and podcast called “Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.“.</p>
<p>The side arguing against the motion “Parenting Is Overrated” won.</p>
<p>Arguing in favor of the motion are behavioral geneticist Robert Plomin and psychology professor and twin researcher Nancy Segal. Arguing against the motion are psychology professor Paige Harden also a twin researcher, who had reached very different conclusions and parenting counselor and journalist Ann Pleshette Murphy.</p>
<p>“Research over 40 years has convinced most scientists that inherited DNA differences account for about 50 percent of the differences between children on all psychological traits: their personalities, their mental health and illness, and their cognitive abilities and disabilities,” moderator John Donvan says. “What amazes me is that if you look at all the parenting books that are out there, and there are very popular books, not one mentions genetics, and that discrepancy is enough to say parenting is overrated because it discounts the importance of genetics.”</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> U.S., World</p>
<p>It’s been a year of the Biden administration. And for many around the world, the question is simple: Can America still lead like it used to? Many who recall the era after the fall of the Berlin Wall remember Washington as both powerful and ascendant. The world’s only superpower boasted a level of military and economic supremacy seldom seen in the modern day. And that juggernaut was coupled with a clear and abundant desire to influence the global order. Things, in many ways, have changed. With China’s competitive rise, a revanchist Russia exercising greater influence in eastern Europe, and American retrenchment in places like Afghanistan and Syria, the role of U.S. leadership is less clear. President Biden, following his predecessor's “America First” policy, promised to “restore the soul of America.” Many took that to mean Washington was looking to re-cement its role as the pre-eminent global leader. But some say that ship has sailed, and question whether the tables are decidedly turning. In light of this emerging divide, we debate this question: Is America retreating from global leadership?</p>
