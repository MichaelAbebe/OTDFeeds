<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Environment, Tech</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">From the start of agriculture to the Industrial Revolution and beyond, humanity has changed and thrived at a level previously unseen in history. Some worry that the abundant present we live in now will change for the worse, due to environmental challenges and a shifting geopolitical landscape. Meanwhile, there is increased connectivity to resources and improved standards of living. Will tomorrow be better than today? Those who agree say that humanity is more prosperous than ever, mortality rates are dropping while living standards and access to resources are increasing, and we’re taking necessary steps to mitigate the beginning effects of climate change. Those who disagree point out that there are widening socio-economic disparities. They also say deglobalization will cause the collapse of consumption and global trade, and the environmental crisis is almost at the point of no return.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With this background, we debate the question: Will the Future Be Abundant? This debate was a virtual event on Wednesday, November 1st for subscribers to join before the episode is released publicly.</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">In recent years, the U.S. has seen a surge in the number of migrants and asylum seekers at its borders, which has strained existing border security and immigration systems. The Secure the Border Act of 2023 aims to change immigration law by enforcing stricter controls and limitations on immigration, impacting asylum seekers, migrant children, employers, and individuals overstaying visas, among other provisions. It has passed in the GOP-led House, communicating its views on signature policy, but it has had little discussion in the Democrat-led Senate and the Biden administration has threatened to veto the act. Republican senators now also want to pair the bill with additional aid to Ukraine and other U.S. allies. Those who support the policies included in the act describe it as a necessary response to improve national security and will help modernize border security infrastructure. Those arguing against it are concerned about the humanitarian impact of stricter border controls, particularly on vulnerable populations, and question the high cost and effectiveness of physical barriers and increased enforcement. </span>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The centrist group No Labels is planning to host a bipartisan nominating convention in 2024. This is leading some people to speculate that they may promote a third-party candidate that better reflects the perspective of middle-of-the-line voters who don’t favor President Biden’s re-election bid or Donald Trump receiving the Republican nomination. Those who say it will help Trump argue the group doesn’t have enough influence to make lasting tangible change and worry that promoting a third-party unity ticket will give an unpopular candidate like Trump a lower threshold for votes that would’ve gone to Biden. Those who disagree say voters who are discontented with both major parties but particularly opposed to Trump, might turn out in support of the third-party candidate, indirectly reducing Trump's chances.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With this context, we debate the question: “</span><span data-contrast="auto">How Would A No Labels Presidential Candidate Change the Outcome in 2024?"

<p>Are we the true authors of our actions – or are we guided by a preordained fate? From the days of Greek philosophers to the present, the notion of free will and the question of whether humans can make their own choices is as captivating as ever. Those who think that free will exists consider it foundational to a rules-based society<b data-stringify-type="bold"> </b>since it holds individuals accountable for their actions. Those who don’t believe in it argue everything that happens to us, and our actions and choices, is determined by prior existing conditions. Though we may feel in control of our actions, they are influenced by factors outside of our control, like upbringing, societal pressures, and biological predispositions.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, U.S.</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, or Eddie Murphy jokes would be deemed offensive by today’s standards? From comedy specials to TV shows and movies, what makes us laugh has come under scrutiny. Some old jokes and racy skits are considered off-limits in today's context, leading to public apologies, cancellations, and backlash. While society wants more inclusivity and awareness, comedy has now become a cultural battleground. Some argue that political correctness will stifle comedic creativity and worry it will affect comedy’s ability to tackle tough subjects, leading to self-censorship and lack of depth or free speech. Those who disagree say comedy, like all art forms, has always evolved with changing societal norms and it can still flourish without relying on harmful stereotypes or tropes. Instead, acting more sensitive or woke will refine and elevate comedy.</span> <span data-contrast="auto"> </span>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education, Law</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In recent years, America’s colleges and universities have begun to adopt Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DEI, as a core value. As part of this push, colleges include criteria of DEI expectations in tenure standards, and getting hired or promoted requires personal, detailed statements. Are these statements, created with good intentions, devaluing merit-based evaluation and replacing viewpoint diversity with a “loyalty oath”? Those who agree say the evaluation rubrics demerit professors who may not embrace a specific agenda, which can harm freedom of speech and academic freedom. Those who disagree argue it’s fair for faculty to be asked about DEI when those values are embedded in a school’s mission. They insist that these statements are not intended to push an ideological viewpoint, but to focus on and reward actions. </span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With this background, we debate the question: Are DEI Mandates for University Faculties a Bad Idea?</span></p>

<p>For many progressives, it was a big moment. In 2019, Congress was holding its first hearing (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/slavery-reparations-hearing.html) on whether the United States should pay reparations for slavery.</p>
<p>To support the idea, Democrats invited the influential author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who had revived the reparations issue in an article in The Atlantic, and the actor and activist Danny Glover.</p>
<p>Republicans turned to a virtual unknown: a 23-year-old philosophy major at Columbia University, Coleman Hughes.
In the hearing, Mr. Hughes, looking very much his age, testified (https://www.c-span.org/video/?461767-1/hearing-slavery-reparations) to the House subcommittee that not paying reparations after the Civil War was “one of the greatest injustices ever perpetrated.”</p>
<p>But, he continued, they should not be paid now. “There’s a difference between acknowledging history and allowing history to distract us from the problems we face today,” he said, pointing to endemic problems that affect Black Americans, such as poor schools, dangerous neighborhoods and a punitive criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Some in the audience booed. The Democratic subcommittee chairman, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, pleaded for calm — “chill, chill” — but then suggested that Mr. Hughes’s testimony had been presumptuous.</p>
<p>More than four years later, Mr. Hughes, now 27, has emerged as something of a rarity in the tense national conversation over how race should factor into public policy: He is a young Black conservative, who argues — in his writings, a podcast and a YouTube channel with about 173,000 subscribers — that schools have taught students of his generation to obsess over their racial identity, while blocking arguments that challenge their worldview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes is not the first Black thinker to reject progressive politics or criticize the educational establishment. But unlike most of his conservative mentors, Mr. Hughes is young enough to have been raised in the very pedagogy that they decry.</p>
<p>In his new book (https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671726/the-end-of-race-politics-by-coleman-hughes/), “The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America,” to be released on Feb. 6, Mr. Hughes recounts what it was like to grow up in the liberal enclave of Montclair, N.J., and then to head to Columbia, where he said the campus culture was fixated on affinity groups, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, microaggressions and “white privilege.”</p>
<p>He uses these stories to argue for a colorblind society.</p>
<p>The goal is not to avoid noticing race, which he says is impossible. (In fact, he admonishes people who say things like, “I don’t see color” and asks them to use phrases like, “I try to treat people without regard to race.”)</p>
<p>“The aim of colorblindness,” he writes, “is to consciously disregard race as a reason to treat individuals differently and as a category on which to base public policy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes says that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired his views, and often repeats a memorable line from the “I Have a Dream” speech: that one day, children “will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
His arguments have infuriated his critics, who say that he ignores the deep racial inequities that plague American society, on everything from schools to income to housing. And, they say, he willfully misrepresents Dr. King’s speech, which also protested persistent segregation, police brutality and Black poverty.</p>
<p>“Even those who are still well off financially still suffer from racism,” said (https://www.ted.com/talks/coleman_hughes_and_jamelle_bouie_does_color_blindness_perpetuate_racism) Monnica Williams, a psychologist, in an online debate that Mr. Hughes participated in.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes, in turn, has a harsh assessment of progressives who he says see American society in terms of white and nonwhite, with white people as historical oppressors. In his book, he calls them “neoracists.”</p>
<p>“Neoracists,” he writes, “are the most likely to insist that someone with European ancestry must not open a Mexican food restaurant.”</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Hughes said his views on colorblindness were gaining broader acceptance. But he sees a long road ahead toward realizing a campus culture where unorthodox views, on the left or right, are not harshly shouted down.</p>
<p>“I would agree that cancel culture peaked,” he said. “But to say that something peaked and then declines is not necessarily to say we’re at a very good place.”</p>
<p>In his book, Mr. Hughes writes that his father’s family can trace its ancestry back to an enslaved gardener who worked at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. And although he is light on specifics, he describes a comfortable childhood in Montclair, a suburb of New York, where he had diverse friends who largely paid little attention to race.</p>
<p>His first encounter with diversity programs, he writes, was as a high school student in private school, which sent him to a three-day conference for students of color. It was there that he first heard terms like “white privilege” and “intersectionality.” There was an atmosphere of “stifling conformism,” he writes, with dissent strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he was befuddled by students who complained of being surrounded by white supremacy. He found the campus to be “one of the most progressive, nonracist environments on Earth.”</p>
<p>Why, he asks, “did these kids sound more pessimistic about the state of American race relations than my grandparents (who lived through segregation)?”</p>
<p>He bonded with a few like-minded students and professors like John McWhorter, who said he considered Mr. Hughes like a son. (Mr. McWhorter also writes for The New York Times Opinion section.) Christian Gonzalez, a college friend, said that at times their experiences felt disorienting, with some students occasionally accusing them of upholding white supremacy.</p>
<p>“It is hard to swim against the tide like that when 80 percent of the people around you have different views,” said Mr. Gonzalez, who is now a doctoral student. “You can start to think you’re crazy.”</p>
<p>Kmele Foster, a 43-year-old libertarian-leaning political commentator, became friends with Mr. Hughes after seeing some of his work online. He said that Black conservatives of his generation had much less to contend with than Mr. Hughes did.</p>
<p>“I suspect,” Mr. Foster said, “that Coleman, going into a polarized environment in college where it was more explicitly frowned upon for having his views, was probably better prepared for what would come at him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes said he started writing for the conservative website Quillette (https://quillette.com/) after the student newspaper at Columbia was mostly uninterested in publishing his opinion pieces.</p>
<p>He described feeling social castigation, and sometimes isolation. There was the time, for instance, when he matched with a classmate on Tinder only to be rejected once she discovered his writings. “Right before the date,” he recalled, “she said to me: ‘I just read your Quillette piece. I could never go on a date with someone who doesn’t believe racism exists.’”</p>
<p>“It’s not even close to what I said,” he added. “Nor is it something I would ever say.”</p>
<p>His Quillette articles, however, grabbed the attention of the Republicans on the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice (https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-117th-congress/constitution-civil-rights-and-civil-liberties). Some of Mr. Hughes’s friends advised him not to testify, arguing that accepting an invitation from House Republicans was bad optics.</p>
<p>Despite the palpable hostility from some in the audience, Mr. Hughes sat calmly throughout the hearing, occasionally sipping from a bottle of water. But the heckling unsettled him, he said.</p>
<p>“People were shouting ‘shame!’ at him as he walked out the door,” said Thomas Chatterton Williams, a friend and writer who shares many of Mr. Hughes views on race. “Coleman is a really tough guy to shake up, but I know he didn’t feel good about that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes channeled the experience into music. Mr. Hughes, who studied briefly at Juilliard before enrolling at Columbia, raps under the stage name Coldxman and plays the jazz trombone. After the hearing, he wrote a song called “Blasphemy” that was released last year on his album “Amor Fati,” a Latin phrase that means “love of one’s fate.” In one verse, he says, “Charge me with thinking and put me in prison, serving a sentence for sentences written.”</p>
<p>He joined the right-leaning Manhattan Institute (https://manhattan.institute/person/coleman-hughes?top=false&limit=10&page-number=2&people%5B%5D=46139&dates=) as a fellow and continued writing occasionally for Quillette. Forgoing a more high-profile career path as a commentator — like signing on as a columnist with a large publication or joining a cable news channel as a contributor — he started his own podcast (https://podcasts.apple.com/cz/podcast/conversations-with-coleman/id1489326460?l=cs), Conversations With Coleman.</p>
<p>That independence helps insulate him from blowback.</p>
<p>Being on his own means, “there’s no employer to target if you don’t like Coleman’s position,” said Mr. Williams, the writer. “There’s no university to complain to, no newspaper to tweet angrily at.”</p>
<p>But that does not mean he is accepted. Mr. Hughes said the most perplexing episode involved his talk last year at the annual TED conference.</p>
<p>In his 10-minute presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxB3b7fxMEA), Mr. Hughes called for public policy to help people based on income, which he called, “the best way to lower the temperature of tribal conflict in the long run.”</p>
<p>The audience was mostly positive, but a handful of critics, including members of TED’s staff, complained that the talk had been upsetting, harmful and inaccurate, even though it had been fact-checked by the organization.</p>
<p>Some employees started an internal campaign to prevent Mr. Hughes’s talk from being promoted, according to accounts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCl-5vC7aW8&ab_channel=SamHarris) provided by Mr. Hughes and the head of TED, Chris Anderson.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Anderson said, the talk was not initially included in TED’s most popular podcast. TED also buried the presentation on its website, until several months later when a prominent speaker on the TED circuit, Tim Urban, pointed it out.</p>
<p>And Mr. Anderson asked Mr. Hughes to participate in a debate (https://www.ted.com/talks/coleman_hughes_and_jamelle_bouie_does_color_blindness_perpetuate_racism) with Jamelle Bouie, a New York Times columnist — the same one that Ms. Williams, the psychologist, took part in — so that TED could have a counter perspective.</p>
<p>“It was very much a heckler’s veto situation,” Mr. Hughes said. “I said: ‘OK, fine. I’ll do this extra debate, even though you don’t make anyone else do it.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes said he had no plans to attend this year’s TED conference but also would not be opposed to going if invited back.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster, the political commentator, says such experiences can weigh on people, even for those with the thickest skin: “It can still be pretty hurtful to have people suggest that when you take a position, it’s some sort of betrayal to your ‘people.’”</p></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education, Law</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In recent years, America’s colleges and universities have begun to adopt Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, or DEI, as a core value. As part of this push, colleges include criteria of DEI expectations in tenure standards, and getting hired or promoted requires personal, detailed statements. Are these statements, created with good intentions, devaluing merit-based evaluation and replacing viewpoint diversity with a “loyalty oath”? Those who agree say the evaluation rubrics demerit professors who may not embrace a specific agenda, which can harm freedom of speech and academic freedom. Those who disagree argue it’s fair for faculty to be asked about DEI when those values are embedded in a school’s mission. They insist that these statements are not intended to push an ideological viewpoint, but to focus on and reward actions. </span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With this background, we debate the question: Are DEI Mandates for University Faculties a Bad Idea?</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Narendra Modi is India’s current Prime Minister and a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He made his first US state visit in June 2023, which sees India as a vital partner for safety in the Indo-Pacific region and counterterrorism. Under his tenure, India has downgraded from being a free democracy to an electoral autocracy, according to V-Dem Institute, but he’s popular among citizens and members of the Indian diaspora. Is there hope for better times? Those who agree applaud Modi’s efforts to tackle corruption, increase technological advancements, and promote India as a global player on the world stage. They also point to India’s strong economic growth and development, with India projected as the fastest-growing large economy this year. Those who disagree note increasing religious and social tensions, corruption of institutions, and limited freedom of expression, while arguing his economic policies aren’t good for everyone. They’re also concerned about pro-Hindu divisive policies and the impact they have on Muslims and other marginalized communities.</span>

While a two-party system has been the standard, third parties have occasionally challenged this status quo but have often failed to gain significant traction.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Law</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to an October 2022 Pew survey, “88% of US adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use.” While marijuana legalization is gaining more and more cultural acceptance, effectively regulating drugs has long flummoxed policy and lawmakers. Some are even starting to have second thoughts, especially when it comes to how to practically enforce legal sales. In fact, voters in Oklahoma – one of the nation’s leading weed markets –overwhelmingly rejected recreational legalization earlier this year, even though voters backed medical marijuana legalization by a double-digit margin in 2018. Those who argue “Yes” for marijuana legalization say legalization creates more problems for our legal system because it requires extra enforcement to crack down on already robust illegal markets to make way for new, regulated, and legal markets. Additionally, competition from illegal weed markets is undercutting legal sales, which means the expected revenue stream from a legalized industry is far lower than expected. Those who argue “No” say legalization can reduce the burden on law enforcement and criminal justice systems, allowing resources to be redirected to more pressing issues. They also highlight marijuana’s medical benefits, such as for pain management and treatment of certain health conditions, which have made a difference in people’s lives.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">With this context, it’s time to debate — and reconsider — “Is Legalizing Marijuana A Mistake?”</span></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Economics, Law</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to an October 2022 Pew survey, “88% of US adults say that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use.” While marijuana legalization is gaining more and more cultural acceptance, effectively regulating drugs has long flummoxed policy and lawmakers. Some are even starting to have second thoughts, especially when it comes to how to practically enforce legal sales. In fact, voters in Oklahoma – one of the nation’s leading weed markets –overwhelmingly rejected recreational legalization earlier this year, even though voters backed medical marijuana legalization by a double-digit margin in 2018. Those who argue “Yes” for marijuana legalization say legalization creates more problems for our legal system because it requires extra enforcement to crack down on already robust illegal markets to make way for new, regulated, and legal markets. Additionally, competition from illegal weed markets is undercutting legal sales, which means the expected revenue stream from a legalized industry is far lower than expected. Those who argue “No” say legalization can reduce the burden on law enforcement and criminal justice systems, allowing resources to be redirected to more pressing issues. They also highlight marijuana’s medical benefits, such as for pain management and treatment of certain health conditions, which have made a difference in people’s lives.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">With this context, it’s time to debate — and reconsider — “Is Legalizing Marijuana A Mistake?”</span></p>

<p>In the 2004 film <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, Kate Winslet’s character undergoes a procedure to erase her bad memories of her ex-boyfriend. But what if we could do the same in real life? Neurotechnology techniques, such as decoded neurofeedback, open the possibilities of influencing the brain’s neural activity to modify or erase memories that aren’t pleasant or beneficial to our well-being. Those who argue in favor say it could help offer a path to psychological well-being and emotional healing from traumatic and painful memories that lead to anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Those forgotten painful, unwanted memories would give rise to a mentally healthier and happier life. Those who argue against it cite ethical and biological issues, since it interferes with the body’s natural process, and say that tampering with memories could be dangerous to our sense of self and undermine the authenticity of our lived experiences, especially since it is often the bad memories or experiences that shape iconic leaders to drive social change, artists to create, and inspire the underdog to be the MVP.
With this background, we take on the question: Should We Erase Bad Memories?

<p>During Black History Month, we reflect on a debate that confronts America’s complex history with racial and social inequality. How can we ensure fair treatment for all in the workplace, on campuses, and in our personal interactions? Is it possible to imagine a future beyond race? As we honor this month of remembrance and celebration, we revisit a conversation that confronts the challenges of our past and the promise of a future that aspires to secure equitable opportunities for all.

<div class='news-content'><p>Coleman Hughes wants a colorblind society. In his new book, he recounts how schools emphasized his racial identity — and other students’ white privilege.</p>
<p>Coleman Hughes in Queens, N.Y., on Tuesday. Mr. Hughes has emerged as something of a rarity in the tense national conversation over how race should factor into public policy.Credit...José A. Alvarado Jr. for The New York Times</p>
<p>For many progressives, it was a big moment. In 2019, Congress was holding its first hearing (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/slavery-reparations-hearing.html) on whether the United States should pay reparations for slavery.</p>
<p>To support the idea, Democrats invited the influential author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who had revived the reparations issue in an article in The Atlantic, and the actor and activist Danny Glover.</p>
<p>Republicans turned to a virtual unknown: a 23-year-old philosophy major at Columbia University, Coleman Hughes.
In the hearing, Mr. Hughes, looking very much his age, testified (https://www.c-span.org/video/?461767-1/hearing-slavery-reparations) to the House subcommittee that not paying reparations after the Civil War was “one of the greatest injustices ever perpetrated.”</p>
<p>But, he continued, they should not be paid now. “There’s a difference between acknowledging history and allowing history to distract us from the problems we face today,” he said, pointing to endemic problems that affect Black Americans, such as poor schools, dangerous neighborhoods and a punitive criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Some in the audience booed. The Democratic subcommittee chairman, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, pleaded for calm — “chill, chill” — but then suggested that Mr. Hughes’s testimony had been presumptuous.</p>
<p>More than four years later, Mr. Hughes, now 27, has emerged as something of a rarity in the tense national conversation over how race should factor into public policy: He is a young Black conservative, who argues — in his writings, a podcast and a YouTube channel with about 173,000 subscribers — that schools have taught students of his generation to obsess over their racial identity, while blocking arguments that challenge their worldview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes is not the first Black thinker to reject progressive politics or criticize the educational establishment. But unlike most of his conservative mentors, Mr. Hughes is young enough to have been raised in the very pedagogy that they decry.</p>
<p>In his new book (https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671726/the-end-of-race-politics-by-coleman-hughes/), “The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America,” to be released on Feb. 6, Mr. Hughes recounts what it was like to grow up in the liberal enclave of Montclair, N.J., and then to head to Columbia, where he said the campus culture was fixated on affinity groups, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, microaggressions and “white privilege.”</p>
<p>He uses these stories to argue for a colorblind society.</p>
<p>The goal is not to avoid noticing race, which he says is impossible. (In fact, he admonishes people who say things like, “I don’t see color” and asks them to use phrases like, “I try to treat people without regard to race.”)</p>
<p>“The aim of colorblindness,” he writes, “is to consciously disregard race as a reason to treat individuals differently and as a category on which to base public policy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes says that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired his views, and often repeats a memorable line from the “I Have a Dream” speech: that one day, children “will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
His arguments have infuriated his critics, who say that he ignores the deep racial inequities that plague American society, on everything from schools to income to housing. And, they say, he willfully misrepresents Dr. King’s speech, which also protested persistent segregation, police brutality and Black poverty.</p>
<p>“Even those who are still well off financially still suffer from racism,” said (https://www.ted.com/talks/coleman_hughes_and_jamelle_bouie_does_color_blindness_perpetuate_racism) Monnica Williams, a psychologist, in an online debate that Mr. Hughes participated in.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes, in turn, has a harsh assessment of progressives who he says see American society in terms of white and nonwhite, with white people as historical oppressors. In his book, he calls them “neoracists.”</p>
<p>“Neoracists,” he writes, “are the most likely to insist that someone with European ancestry must not open a Mexican food restaurant.”</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Hughes said his views on colorblindness were gaining broader acceptance. But he sees a long road ahead toward realizing a campus culture where unorthodox views, on the left or right, are not harshly shouted down.</p>
<p>“I would agree that cancel culture peaked,” he said. “But to say that something peaked and then declines is not necessarily to say we’re at a very good place.”</p>
<p>In his book, Mr. Hughes writes that his father’s family can trace its ancestry back to an enslaved gardener who worked at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. And although he is light on specifics, he describes a comfortable childhood in Montclair, a suburb of New York, where he had diverse friends who largely paid little attention to race.</p>
<p>His first encounter with diversity programs, he writes, was as a high school student in private school, which sent him to a three-day conference for students of color. It was there that he first heard terms like “white privilege” and “intersectionality.” There was an atmosphere of “stifling conformism,” he writes, with dissent strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he was befuddled by students who complained of being surrounded by white supremacy. He found the campus to be “one of the most progressive, nonracist environments on Earth.”</p>
<p>Why, he asks, “did these kids sound more pessimistic about the state of American race relations than my grandparents (who lived through segregation)?”</p>
<p>He bonded with a few like-minded students and professors like John McWhorter, who said he considered Mr. Hughes like a son. (Mr. McWhorter also writes for The New York Times Opinion section.) Christian Gonzalez, a college friend, said that at times their experiences felt disorienting, with some students occasionally accusing them of upholding white supremacy.</p>
<p>“It is hard to swim against the tide like that when 80 percent of the people around you have different views,” said Mr. Gonzalez, who is now a doctoral student. “You can start to think you’re crazy.”</p>
<p>Kmele Foster, a 43-year-old libertarian-leaning political commentator, became friends with Mr. Hughes after seeing some of his work online. He said that Black conservatives of his generation had much less to contend with than Mr. Hughes did.</p>
<p>“I suspect,” Mr. Foster said, “that Coleman, going into a polarized environment in college where it was more explicitly frowned upon for having his views, was probably better prepared for what would come at him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes said he started writing for the conservative website Quillette (https://quillette.com/) after the student newspaper at Columbia was mostly uninterested in publishing his opinion pieces.</p>
<p>He described feeling social castigation, and sometimes isolation. There was the time, for instance, when he matched with a classmate on Tinder only to be rejected once she discovered his writings. “Right before the date,” he recalled, “she said to me: ‘I just read your Quillette piece. I could never go on a date with someone who doesn’t believe racism exists.’”</p>
<p>“It’s not even close to what I said,” he added. “Nor is it something I would ever say.”</p>
<p>His Quillette articles, however, grabbed the attention of the Republicans on the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice (https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-117th-congress/constitution-civil-rights-and-civil-liberties). Some of Mr. Hughes’s friends advised him not to testify, arguing that accepting an invitation from House Republicans was bad optics.</p>
<p>Despite the palpable hostility from some in the audience, Mr. Hughes sat calmly throughout the hearing, occasionally sipping from a bottle of water. But the heckling unsettled him, he said.</p>
<p>“People were shouting ‘shame!’ at him as he walked out the door,” said Thomas Chatterton Williams, a friend and writer who shares many of Mr. Hughes views on race. “Coleman is a really tough guy to shake up, but I know he didn’t feel good about that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes channeled the experience into music. Mr. Hughes, who studied briefly at Juilliard before enrolling at Columbia, raps under the stage name Coldxman and plays the jazz trombone. After the hearing, he wrote a song called “Blasphemy” that was released last year on his album “Amor Fati,” a Latin phrase that means “love of one’s fate.” In one verse, he says, “Charge me with thinking and put me in prison, serving a sentence for sentences written.”</p>
<p>He joined the right-leaning Manhattan Institute (https://manhattan.institute/person/coleman-hughes?top=false&limit=10&page-number=2&people%5B%5D=46139&dates=) as a fellow and continued writing occasionally for Quillette. Forgoing a more high-profile career path as a commentator — like signing on as a columnist with a large publication or joining a cable news channel as a contributor — he started his own podcast (https://podcasts.apple.com/cz/podcast/conversations-with-coleman/id1489326460?l=cs), Conversations With Coleman.</p>
<p>That independence helps insulate him from blowback.</p>
<p>Being on his own means, “there’s no employer to target if you don’t like Coleman’s position,” said Mr. Williams, the writer. “There’s no university to complain to, no newspaper to tweet angrily at.”</p>
<p>But that does not mean he is accepted. Mr. Hughes said the most perplexing episode involved his talk last year at the annual TED conference.</p>
<p>In his 10-minute presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxB3b7fxMEA), Mr. Hughes called for public policy to help people based on income, which he called, “the best way to lower the temperature of tribal conflict in the long run.”</p>
<p>The audience was mostly positive, but a handful of critics, including members of TED’s staff, complained that the talk had been upsetting, harmful and inaccurate, even though it had been fact-checked by the organization.</p>
<p>Some employees started an internal campaign to prevent Mr. Hughes’s talk from being promoted, according to accounts (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCl-5vC7aW8&ab_channel=SamHarris) provided by Mr. Hughes and the head of TED, Chris Anderson.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Anderson said, the talk was not initially included in TED’s most popular podcast. TED also buried the presentation on its website, until several months later when a prominent speaker on the TED circuit, Tim Urban, pointed it out.</p>
<p>And Mr. Anderson asked Mr. Hughes to participate in a debate (https://www.ted.com/talks/coleman_hughes_and_jamelle_bouie_does_color_blindness_perpetuate_racism) with Jamelle Bouie, a New York Times columnist — the same one that Ms. Williams, the psychologist, took part in — so that TED could have a counter perspective.</p>
<p>“It was very much a heckler’s veto situation,” Mr. Hughes said. “I said: ‘OK, fine. I’ll do this extra debate, even though you don’t make anyone else do it.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes said he had no plans to attend this year’s TED conference but also would not be opposed to going if invited back.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster, the political commentator, says such experiences can weigh on people, even for those with the thickest skin: “It can still be pretty hurtful to have people suggest that when you take a position, it’s some sort of betrayal to your ‘people.’”</p></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Education, Politics, U.S.</p>
<p>During Black History Month, we reflect on a debate that confronts America’s complex history with racial and social inequality. How can we ensure fair treatment for all in the workplace, on campuses, and in our personal interactions? Is it possible to imagine a future beyond race? As we honor this month of remembrance and celebration, we revisit a conversation that confronts the challenges of our past and the promise of a future that aspires to secure equitable opportunities for all.

<p>Coleman Hughes in Queens, N.Y., on Tuesday. Mr. Hughes has emerged as something of a rarity in the tense national conversation over how race should factor into public policy.Credit...José A. Alvarado Jr. for The New York Times</p>
<p>For many progressives, it was a big moment. In 2019, Congress was holding its first hearing (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/slavery-reparations-hearing.html) on whether the United States should pay reparations for slavery.</p>
<p>To support the idea, Democrats invited the influential author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who had revived the reparations issue in an article in The Atlantic, and the actor and activist Danny Glover.</p>
<p>Republicans turned to a virtual unknown: a 23-year-old philosophy major at Columbia University, Coleman Hughes.
In the hearing, Mr. Hughes, looking very much his age, testified (https://www.c-span.org/video/?461767-1/hearing-slavery-reparations) to the House subcommittee that not paying reparations after the Civil War was “one of the greatest injustices ever perpetrated.”</p>
<p>But, he continued, they should not be paid now. “There’s a difference between acknowledging history and allowing history to distract us from the problems we face today,” he said, pointing to endemic problems that affect Black Americans, such as poor schools, dangerous neighborhoods and a punitive criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Some in the audience booed. The Democratic subcommittee chairman, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, pleaded for calm — “chill, chill” — but then suggested that Mr. Hughes’s testimony had been presumptuous.</p>
<p>More than four years later, Mr. Hughes, now 27, has emerged as something of a rarity in the tense national conversation over how race should factor into public policy: He is a young Black conservative, who argues — in his writings, a podcast and a YouTube channel with about 173,000 subscribers — that schools have taught students of his generation to obsess over their racial identity, while blocking arguments that challenge their worldview.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes is not the first Black thinker to reject progressive politics or criticize the educational establishment. But unlike most of his conservative mentors, Mr. Hughes is young enough to have been raised in the very pedagogy that they decry.</p>
<p>In his new book (https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/671726/the-end-of-race-politics-by-coleman-hughes/), “The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America,” to be released on Feb. 6, Mr. Hughes recounts what it was like to grow up in the liberal enclave of Montclair, N.J., and then to head to Columbia, where he said the campus culture was fixated on affinity groups, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, microaggressions and “white privilege.”</p>
<p>He uses these stories to argue for a colorblind society.</p>
<p>The goal is not to avoid noticing race, which he says is impossible. (In fact, he admonishes people who say things like, “I don’t see color” and asks them to use phrases like, “I try to treat people without regard to race.”)</p>
<p>“The aim of colorblindness,” he writes, “is to consciously disregard race as a reason to treat individuals differently and as a category on which to base public policy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes says that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspired his views, and often repeats a memorable line from the “I Have a Dream” speech: that one day, children “will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
His arguments have infuriated his critics, who say that he ignores the deep racial inequities that plague American society, on everything from schools to income to housing. And, they say, he willfully misrepresents Dr. King’s speech, which also protested persistent segregation, police brutality and Black poverty.</p>
<p>“Even those who are still well off financially still suffer from racism,” said (https://www.ted.com/talks/coleman_hughes_and_jamelle_bouie_does_color_blindness_perpetuate_racism) Monnica Williams, a psychologist, in an online debate that Mr. Hughes participated in.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes, in turn, has a harsh assessment of progressives who he says see American society in terms of white and nonwhite, with white people as historical oppressors. In his book, he calls them “neoracists.”</p>
<p>“Neoracists,” he writes, “are the most likely to insist that someone with European ancestry must not open a Mexican food restaurant.”</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Hughes said his views on colorblindness were gaining broader acceptance. But he sees a long road ahead toward realizing a campus culture where unorthodox views, on the left or right, are not harshly shouted down.</p>
<p>“I would agree that cancel culture peaked,” he said. “But to say that something peaked and then declines is not necessarily to say we’re at a very good place.”</p>
<p>In his book, Mr. Hughes writes that his father’s family can trace its ancestry back to an enslaved gardener who worked at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. And although he is light on specifics, he describes a comfortable childhood in Montclair, a suburb of New York, where he had diverse friends who largely paid little attention to race.</p>
<p>His first encounter with diversity programs, he writes, was as a high school student in private school, which sent him to a three-day conference for students of color. It was there that he first heard terms like “white privilege” and “intersectionality.” There was an atmosphere of “stifling conformism,” he writes, with dissent strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>At Columbia, he was befuddled by students who complained of being surrounded by white supremacy. He found the campus to be “one of the most progressive, nonracist environments on Earth.”</p>
<p>Why, he asks, “did these kids sound more pessimistic about the state of American race relations than my grandparents (who lived through segregation)?”</p>
<p>He bonded with a few like-minded students and professors like John McWhorter, who said he considered Mr. Hughes like a son. (Mr. McWhorter also writes for The New York Times Opinion section.) Christian Gonzalez, a college friend, said that at times their experiences felt disorienting, with some students occasionally accusing them of upholding white supremacy.</p>
<p>“It is hard to swim against the tide like that when 80 percent of the people around you have different views,” said Mr. Gonzalez, who is now a doctoral student. “You can start to think you’re crazy.”</p>
<p>Kmele Foster, a 43-year-old libertarian-leaning political commentator, became friends with Mr. Hughes after seeing some of his work online. He said that Black conservatives of his generation had much less to contend with than Mr. Hughes did.</p>
<p>“I suspect,” Mr. Foster said, “that Coleman, going into a polarized environment in college where it was more explicitly frowned upon for having his views, was probably better prepared for what would come at him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes said he started writing for the conservative website Quillette (https://quillette.com/) after the student newspaper at Columbia was mostly uninterested in publishing his opinion pieces.</p>
<p>He described feeling social castigation, and sometimes isolation. There was the time, for instance, when he matched with a classmate on Tinder only to be rejected once she discovered his writings. “Right before the date,” he recalled, “she said to me: ‘I just read your Quillette piece. I could never go on a date with someone who doesn’t believe racism exists.’”</p>
<p>“It’s not even close to what I said,” he added. “Nor is it something I would ever say.”</p>
<p>His Quillette articles, however, grabbed the attention of the Republicans on the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice (https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/committee-judiciary-117th-congress/constitution-civil-rights-and-civil-liberties).

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Currently, NATO has 31 member countries and there are four countries that have declared their desire to join the alliance, which includes Ukraine.

<p><span class="TextRun SCXO189745730 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO189745730 BCX0">In the United States, around 13 million misdemeanor cases are filed each year, which makes up about 80% of all cases that are processed. The district attorney’s offices in areas like Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and Manhattan have implemented new policies stating they would no longer prosecute certain low-level, nonviolent crimes —such as drug possession, disorderly conduct, shoplifting, prostitution, and certain other offenses — as long as they did not accompany felonies. The reasoning given is while ¾ of nonviolent misdemeanor cases don’t turn into convictions, this still permanently affects the person’s criminal record, job prospects, and ability to secure housing and these consequences are especially felt by people of color, people experiencing poverty, and LGBTQ people. Yet, those who argue “yes” to prosecuting minor crimes say it has important societal benefits. They argue that it is an essential way of keeping our communities safe and that not strengthening sentencing will let violent criminals back onto the street, fail to protect crime victims, and increase crime rates in cities. Those who argue “no” say it doesn’t work to deter criminals or to decrease the chance of committing other crimes, and it distracts from better solutions like rehabilitation or community service.  They also point to recent studies that suggest prosecuting minor crimes, especially those from first-time offenders, actually increases crime.</span></span><span class="EOP SCXO189745730 BCX0"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Many Americans expect to retire at 65, but beginning in 1983, the age of eligibility for full Social Security benefits began gradually increasing to 67. Social Security provides at least half of the income for the elderly to enjoy their golden years. Unfortunately, Social Security’s cash reserves are expected to run out by 2034. If the gap between payroll taxes and cash reserves isn’t resolved, retirees could get lower payments and workers might need to pay more into the system. People arguing “yes” to raising the retirement age say people are now living longer and continuing to work, which could lead to economic growth. Those arguing “no” say that not everyone is able to or can afford to work longer and it’ll mean a large cut in benefits, making the program worse or unhelpful for the next generations.</span>

<div><strong>The Case for Raising the Social Security Retirement Age</strong> <small>2023-07-26 17:39:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Marc Goldwein recently appeared (https://t.co/NBUNqfw6vV) on the “Open to Debate” podcast to discuss the benefits of raising the Social Security retirement age. Taking the other position was Teresa Ghilarducci, Professor of Economics and Policy Analysis at The New School for Social Research.</p>
<p>In the debate, Goldwein explained that:</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would strengthen Social Security solvency, helping to avoid a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in just a decade.
 Raising the retirement age would accelerate economic growth by encouraging more work and savings and signaling some workers to delay their retirement.
 More flexible and delayed retirement can enhance the wellbeing of seniors, boosting their financial wealth, mental and physical health, and overall happiness</p>
<p>Social Security’s normal retirement age (NRA), also called the full retirement age, is currently 67 – though seniors can claim an early eligibility age (EEA) as soon as age 62 or as late as age 70, with monthly benefits adjusted upward or downward depending on collection age.</p>
<p>Under the latest Trustees projections (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/social-security-and-medicare-trustees-release-2023-reports), Social Security’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run out of reserves (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) by 2033, when today’s 57-year-olds reach the normal retirement age and today’s youngest retirees turn 72. At that point the law calls for an immediate 23 percent (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) across-the-board benefit cut.</p>
<p>Restoring solvency to Social Security will likely require a combination of higher revenue (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/ways-and-means-hold-hearing-social-security-2100-act) and slower benefit growth (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/are-social-security-benefits-modest) (design your own plan here (https://www.crfb.org/socialsecurityreformer/)). Goldwein argued that raising the retirement age should be a part of this solution.</p>
<p>According to the program’s chief actuary (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/retireage_summary.html), simply indexing the retirement age for longevity – so workers have a constant ratio of years in work to retirement – would close one-fifth of Social Security’s solvency gap and two-fifths of its structural gap. Under that framework, the retirement age would reach 69 for those retiring around 2075. A faster phase-in could generate further solvency improvements, while a well-designed poverty protection benefit (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform) could protect lower-income seniors.
Options to Raise the Social Security Age</p>
<p>Proposal
% of Solvency Gap Closed
% of 75th Year Gap Closed</p>
<p>Raise normal retirement age (NRA) from 67 to 68 (1 mo/2 yrs)
12%
16%</p>
<p>Index NRA to life expectancy (1 mo/2yrs)*
19%
40%</p>
<p>Raise NRA to 69 (2 mo/yr), then index (1 mo/2 yrs)
38%
57%</p>
<p>Raise EEA from 62 to 64 and NRA from 67 to 69 (3 mo/yr)
25%
25%</p>
<p>Raise ages by one year then index, count all years of work equally toward benefits, establish an age 62 poverty protection benefit
15%
25%</p>
<p>Sources: Social Security Office of Chief Actuary, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. *This would maintain constant ratio of years in work to retirement, so years in work and retirement could both grow.</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would boost economic growth (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform), mainly by promoting delayed retirement for those who are able. Although workers are eligible for benefits before the full retirement age and can claim benefits without retiring, the official age nonetheless sends powerful signals for when workers should retire. Indeed, age 67 is the second most popular age in which workers retire, after the earliest eligibility age of 62.</p>
<p>Raising either the early or full age would lead some workers to extend their careers as life expectancy rises, and this additional work would lead to higher output. Based on estimates (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf) from CBO, every one-year increase in the full retirement age would result in nearly three months (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12) of additional work, boosting the size of the labor force and the economy by about 0.5 percent (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12). Raising the earliest age would generate an even stronger effect. Other groups have estimated even larger effects (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=33).</p>
<p>Continued work resulting from changes in retirement signals can also enhance the well-being of seniors themselves. For example, each additional year of work is estimated to increase wealth by 5 percent and retirement income by about 10 percent (https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement). The choice to delay retirement also appears to result in better health (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/retirement/working-longer-may-benefit-your-health.html), stronger social networks (https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wp_2016-15.pdf), lower rates of mortality (https://crr.bc.edu/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/#:~:text=Working%20longer%20is%20associated%20with,in%20ordinary%20linear%20regression%20models.), and other benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-against-early-retirement-11555899000) that improve overall welfare and happiness.</p>
<p>To be sure, the choice to raise the retirement age is not without its trade-offs. As Ghilarducci alluded to in her debate with Goldwein, each one-year increase in the NRA would be the equivalent of a 5 to 6.5 percent reduction in lifetime benefits for most retirees (excluding those with disabilities and many widow(er)s), and there are numerous barriers to employment for older workers. But the Trustees project (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=162) real (inflation-adjusted) initial benefits to roughly triple over the next 75 years, while average life expectancy grows by about four years (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=107) – meaning phasing in a three-year increase in the retirement age will only modestly slow the scheduled expansion of benefits.</p>
<p>Goldwein and Ghilarducci also agreed on the need for better policies to reduce employer discrimination and support older workers, and Goldwein went further by calling for a broader rethink of retirement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibn8l64j_-0) culture – going toward a system that allows and encourages retirement flexibility (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/managed/media-documents2022-02/Chartbook_Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=14).</p></div>]]></description>

<div><strong>The Case for Raising the Social Security Retirement Age</strong> <small>2023-07-26 17:39:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Marc Goldwein recently appeared (https://t.co/NBUNqfw6vV) on the “Open to Debate” podcast to discuss the benefits of raising the Social Security retirement age. Taking the other position was Teresa Ghilarducci, Professor of Economics and Policy Analysis at The New School for Social Research.</p>
<p>In the debate, Goldwein explained that:</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would strengthen Social Security solvency, helping to avoid a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in just a decade.
 Raising the retirement age would accelerate economic growth by encouraging more work and savings and signaling some workers to delay their retirement.
 More flexible and delayed retirement can enhance the wellbeing of seniors, boosting their financial wealth, mental and physical health, and overall happiness</p>
<p>Social Security’s normal retirement age (NRA), also called the full retirement age, is currently 67 – though seniors can claim an early eligibility age (EEA) as soon as age 62 or as late as age 70, with monthly benefits adjusted upward or downward depending on collection age.</p>
<p>Under the latest Trustees projections (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/social-security-and-medicare-trustees-release-2023-reports), Social Security’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run out of reserves (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) by 2033, when today’s 57-year-olds reach the normal retirement age and today’s youngest retirees turn 72. At that point the law calls for an immediate 23 percent (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) across-the-board benefit cut.</p>
<p>Restoring solvency to Social Security will likely require a combination of higher revenue (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/ways-and-means-hold-hearing-social-security-2100-act) and slower benefit growth (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/are-social-security-benefits-modest) (design your own plan here (https://www.crfb.org/socialsecurityreformer/)). Goldwein argued that raising the retirement age should be a part of this solution.</p>
<p>According to the program’s chief actuary (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/retireage_summary.html), simply indexing the retirement age for longevity – so workers have a constant ratio of years in work to retirement – would close one-fifth of Social Security’s solvency gap and two-fifths of its structural gap. Under that framework, the retirement age would reach 69 for those retiring around 2075. A faster phase-in could generate further solvency improvements, while a well-designed poverty protection benefit (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform) could protect lower-income seniors.
Options to Raise the Social Security Age</p>
<p>Proposal
% of Solvency Gap Closed
% of 75th Year Gap Closed</p>
<p>Raise normal retirement age (NRA) from 67 to 68 (1 mo/2 yrs)
12%
16%</p>
<p>Index NRA to life expectancy (1 mo/2yrs)*
19%
40%</p>
<p>Raise NRA to 69 (2 mo/yr), then index (1 mo/2 yrs)
38%
57%</p>
<p>Raise EEA from 62 to 64 and NRA from 67 to 69 (3 mo/yr)
25%
25%</p>
<p>Raise ages by one year then index, count all years of work equally toward benefits, establish an age 62 poverty protection benefit
15%
25%</p>
<p>Sources: Social Security Office of Chief Actuary, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. *This would maintain constant ratio of years in work to retirement, so years in work and retirement could both grow.</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would boost economic growth (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform), mainly by promoting delayed retirement for those who are able. Although workers are eligible for benefits before the full retirement age and can claim benefits without retiring, the official age nonetheless sends powerful signals for when workers should retire. Indeed, age 67 is the second most popular age in which workers retire, after the earliest eligibility age of 62.</p>
<p>Raising either the early or full age would lead some workers to extend their careers as life expectancy rises, and this additional work would lead to higher output. Based on estimates (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf) from CBO, every one-year increase in the full retirement age would result in nearly three months (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12) of additional work, boosting the size of the labor force and the economy by about 0.5 percent (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12). Raising the earliest age would generate an even stronger effect. Other groups have estimated even larger effects (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=33).</p>
<p>Continued work resulting from changes in retirement signals can also enhance the well-being of seniors themselves. For example, each additional year of work is estimated to increase wealth by 5 percent and retirement income by about 10 percent (https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement). The choice to delay retirement also appears to result in better health (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/retirement/working-longer-may-benefit-your-health.html), stronger social networks (https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wp_2016-15.pdf), lower rates of mortality (https://crr.bc.edu/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/#:~:text=Working%20longer%20is%20associated%20with,in%20ordinary%20linear%20regression%20models.), and other benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-against-early-retirement-11555899000) that improve overall welfare and happiness.</p>
<p>To be sure, the choice to raise the retirement age is not without its trade-offs. As Ghilarducci alluded to in her debate with Goldwein, each one-year increase in the NRA would be the equivalent of a 5 to 6.5 percent reduction in lifetime benefits for most retirees (excluding those with disabilities and many widow(er)s), and there are numerous barriers to employment for older workers. But the Trustees project (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=162) real (inflation-adjusted) initial benefits to roughly triple over the next 75 years, while average life expectancy grows by about four years (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=107) – meaning phasing in a three-year increase in the retirement age will only modestly slow the scheduled expansion of benefits.</p>
<p>Goldwein and Ghilarducci also agreed on the need for better policies to reduce employer discrimination and support older workers, and Goldwein went further by calling for a broader rethink of retirement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibn8l64j_-0) culture – going toward a system that allows and encourages retirement flexibility (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/managed/media-documents2022-02/Chartbook_Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=14).</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>Originalism is a way of interpreting the Constitution. In the past, the legal theory referred to framer’s intent, but the contemporary, prevailing view of originalism is that it attempts to understand the Constitution by looking at what the public would’ve intended at the time of ratification. This theory has been used in the Roberts Supreme Court to interpret landmark cases related to race, religion, gun-safety laws, and some say abortion and could be used in others. Those who argue “yes” say the Constitution is like any other document that needs modern interpretation, even if not everything that existed in the text back then exists today. Others who argue “no” explain it doesn’t make sense to keep our laws limited to what society would've valued during the country’s founding and it risks constraining judges into one viewpoint.
In this context, we ask the question: Should the Supreme Court Focus on the Original Meaning of the Constitution?</p>

<p>However, a good deal of the conversation explores themes from his latest book Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism Not Textualism. Breyer’s book and the related discussion provide a frustrating take on judicial philosophy. Not because the justice fails to lay out intellectual case against either textualism or originalism, but because he addresses them with the respect they have done nothing to deserve.</p>
<p>There’s nobility in raising the level of discourse through professional and respectful engagement. But it’s also the kind of nobility that gets offed in the first season of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>It’s a matter of victory conditions. Textualists don’t care about convincing everybody, they just need their trash ideas treated “fairly” by respected people so they can pawn off their worldview as reasonable disagreement. Defenestration via Overton Window.</p>
<p>Efforts to unilaterally elevate the conversation miss the mark because they fail to grasp this victory condition issue. The conservative legal movement doesn’t care that you can respectfully poke holes in their chosen interpretive philosophy — they more or less know it sucks — they just want it treated with unearned dignity on the public stage so they can trade on the patina of credibility that affords.</p>
<p>The Open to Debate crew notes that they recorded a prior debate titled “Should SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, focus on the original meaning of the Constitution?” and I know that because I was on that one! (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-scotus-focus-on-the-original-meaning-of-the-constitution/) (Opens in a new window)I recall Professor Randy Barnett laid out “five normative arguments” for originalism and I was allowed to ask a question at the end prompting him to concede his “number one” argument. If only I’d been able to ask more questions, we could’ve knocked them all out! But the point is even the defender of originalism was willing, when pressed, to admit he wasn’t even persuaded by the top argument he presented. It’s just throwing pasta on the wall and hoping the other side is polite about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean forfeiting critique or descending into Twitter-thread invective. Refusing to engage is its own vice. But tone matters. If the argument registers as polite disagreement rather than scathing teardown, textualists can declare mission accomplished.</p>
<p>If there’s a quote from the discussion that captures this disconnect, it’s this one:
So if you, you say to the textualists, what, uh, “Do you agree with Brown versus Board of Education?” They say, “Yes, of course.”
Ahem.</p>
<p>This isn’t hyperbole. During the first Trump administration, Democrats took to asking his judicial nominees if they would at the very least agree that Brown v. Board was correct and they… struggled mightily (https://abovethelaw.com/2018/04/originalists-do-not-think-segregation-was-unconstitutional-and-wish-youd-stop-bothering-them-about-it/) (Opens in a new window). They weren’t being asked if Brown required a return of bussing or anything, just if — on its own facts — they agreed with the unanimous Supreme Court opinion against Jim Crow education. Koosh balls aren’t even that soft. And yet it caused much hemming and hawing among Trump’s nominees. Indeed, the counsel shepherding GOP nominees through the Judiciary Committee at the time threw a tantrum that it was unfair “gutter politics” to make nominees defend desegregation while under oath (https://abovethelaw.com/2018/05/asking-about-brown-v-board-is-gutter-politics-according-to-senate-judiciary-official/) (Opens in a new window).</p>
<p>So when Justice Breyer grants the champions of textualism and originalism the benefit of the doubt that they would “of course” say they support Brown, he doesn’t grasp the conservative legal movement’s YOLO era where they’ve stopped pretending and just raw dog judicial review. There are certainly still originalist wizards willing to offer lip service to Brown ending de jure segregation while playing semantic games to guarantee de facto segregation, but for a lot of them the hood is now off. Or on as the case may be.</p>
<p>Either way, it renders this academic sparring session with textualism a naive exercise. He’s saying they would say “of course” as if these folks have some good faith belief in Brown, when recent events make pretty clear the movement only ever said “of course” to further the con that their philosophy had any depth to it.</p>
<p>The whole approach feels like chiding Orval Faubus that his articulation of states’ rights misreads the Federalist Papers. As the ubiquitous goose meme would ask, “A STATE’S RIGHT TO DO WHAT?!? (https://x.com/KleptocratWorld/status/1740286530814415237?lang=ar) (Opens in a new window)” The point forcefully expressed by our feathered friend is that the philosophy is inextricable from its purpose. That’s the nut that an academic conversation about this stuff can’t get at: originalism’s whole appeal is that constitutional law was better in the 1700s. “For who?” the goose might ask. Which is wrong because it should be “for whom” but geese are terrible at grammar. But when someone decides they’re an originalist, you can’t haggle with them over finer points of workability — valid though those points may be — because they’re in it for the value it represents. They’re in it because they actually believe in a backward-looking world. Tear down originalism from the ivory towers and they’ll just invent a new mechanism to get there.</p>
<p>Which is all to say the conversation is interesting but incomplete. Until someone in Breyer’s position delivers their sharp argument without conceding the textualist/originalist covert demand for respectability, these discussions do little to derail the steady advance of a jurisprudence of witch-hunters (https://abovethelaw.com/2022/05/just-look-who-alito-cites-in-his-opinion-overturning-roe/) (Opens in a new window).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> June 09, 2023</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p>Originalism is a way of interpreting the Constitution. In the past, the legal theory referred to framer’s intent, but the contemporary, prevailing view of originalism is that it attempts to understand the Constitution by looking at what the public would’ve intended at the time of ratification. This theory has been used in the Roberts Supreme Court to interpret landmark cases related to race, religion, gun-safety laws, and some say abortion and could be used in others. Those who argue “yes” say the Constitution is like any other document that needs modern interpretation, even if not everything that existed in the text back then exists today. Others who argue “no” explain it doesn’t make sense to keep our laws limited to what society would've valued during the country’s founding and it risks constraining judges into one viewpoint.
In this context, we ask the question: Should the Supreme Court Focus on the Original Meaning of the Constitution?</p>

<div><strong>Justice Breyer Dismantles Originalism Like It Deserves Respect. It Doesn’t.</strong> <small>2025-07-08 15:31:26</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The former justice aims to elevate the conversation. It should be pounded into the Earth.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer may no longer sit on the Supreme Court, but he still has thoughts about his old workplace. Tomorrow, Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/) (Opens in a new window)is dropping a wide-ranging interview with Breyer covering everything from his personal account of the day he was nominated to the Supreme Court to the mechanics of the conversations justices have.</p>
<p>He also gives his secret strategy for making sure he’d get assigned an opinion with just three little words.</p>
<p>However, a good deal of the conversation explores themes from his latest book Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism Not Textualism. Breyer’s book and the related discussion provide a frustrating take on judicial philosophy. Not because the justice fails to lay out intellectual case against either textualism or originalism, but because he addresses them with the respect they have done nothing to deserve.</p>
<p>There’s nobility in raising the level of discourse through professional and respectful engagement. But it’s also the kind of nobility that gets offed in the first season of Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>It’s a matter of victory conditions. Textualists don’t care about convincing everybody, they just need their trash ideas treated “fairly” by respected people so they can pawn off their worldview as reasonable disagreement. Defenestration via Overton Window.</p>
<p>Efforts to unilaterally elevate the conversation miss the mark because they fail to grasp this victory condition issue. The conservative legal movement doesn’t care that you can respectfully poke holes in their chosen interpretive philosophy — they more or less know it sucks — they just want it treated with unearned dignity on the public stage so they can trade on the patina of credibility that affords.</p>
<p>The Open to Debate crew notes that they recorded a prior debate titled “Should SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, focus on the original meaning of the Constitution?” and I know that because I was on that one! (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-scotus-focus-on-the-original-meaning-of-the-constitution/) (Opens in a new window)I recall Professor Randy Barnett laid out “five normative arguments” for originalism and I was allowed to ask a question at the end prompting him to concede his “number one” argument. If only I’d been able to ask more questions, we could’ve knocked them all out! But the point is even the defender of originalism was willing, when pressed, to admit he wasn’t even persuaded by the top argument he presented. It’s just throwing pasta on the wall and hoping the other side is polite about it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean forfeiting critique or descending into Twitter-thread invective. Refusing to engage is its own vice. But tone matters. If the argument registers as polite disagreement rather than scathing teardown, textualists can declare mission accomplished.</p>
<p>If there’s a quote from the discussion that captures this disconnect, it’s this one:

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture</p>
<p><p class="p1">Millennials—people born between 1981 and 1996 — have surpassed the Baby Boomers as the largest generation group in the U.S. Now, the oldest Millennials are reaching their forties and feel they don’t have the financial and emotional standing their parents did and have instead been left behind. Those who agree say Millennials are America’s most educated — but broke — generation and pay more for basic items, leading them unable to afford to buy a home or have children. Those who disagree say that not buying a house or having kids are their choices, not based on economic hardship; and really, they will soon be doing well financially because they strive for higher education and better jobs and they are close to reaching their peak earning years, which will help them earn more than the generations before them.</p>
<p class="p1">With this context, we ask the question: Will Millennials be Left Behind?</p>
This debate was produced in front of a live audience, at the Comedy Cellar’s The Village Underground, on June 7, 2023.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The US has more than $31 trillion in national debt. The debt ceiling — or the most the government can borrow from banks, investors, and foreign countries — has been raised more than 70 times. If the debt ceiling is breached, the federal government will be unable to pay its bills or interests on past debts; cover Social Security checks, payroll for veterans and federal employees; and Medicare reimbursements — leading to default. If that happens, a financial crisis may occur with global implications. Supporters in favor of abolishing the debt ceiling say it is counterproductive, leads to political drama, and is an economic threat to the country — and the world. Those in opposition argue that while it’s not the best fiscal rule, it’s an effective tool of governance that allows discussion about national spending and keeps lawmakers accountable.</span>

<div><strong>The Case for Raising the Social Security Retirement Age</strong> <small>2023-07-26 17:39:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Marc Goldwein recently appeared (https://t.co/NBUNqfw6vV) on the “Open to Debate” podcast to discuss the benefits of raising the Social Security retirement age. Taking the other position was Teresa Ghilarducci, Professor of Economics and Policy Analysis at The New School for Social Research.</p>
<p>In the debate, Goldwein explained that:</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would strengthen Social Security solvency, helping to avoid a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in just a decade.
 Raising the retirement age would accelerate economic growth by encouraging more work and savings and signaling some workers to delay their retirement.
 More flexible and delayed retirement can enhance the wellbeing of seniors, boosting their financial wealth, mental and physical health, and overall happiness</p>
<p>Social Security’s normal retirement age (NRA), also called the full retirement age, is currently 67 – though seniors can claim an early eligibility age (EEA) as soon as age 62 or as late as age 70, with monthly benefits adjusted upward or downward depending on collection age.</p>
<p>Under the latest Trustees projections (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/social-security-and-medicare-trustees-release-2023-reports), Social Security’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run out of reserves (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) by 2033, when today’s 57-year-olds reach the normal retirement age and today’s youngest retirees turn 72. At that point the law calls for an immediate 23 percent (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) across-the-board benefit cut.</p>
<p>Restoring solvency to Social Security will likely require a combination of higher revenue (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/ways-and-means-hold-hearing-social-security-2100-act) and slower benefit growth (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/are-social-security-benefits-modest) (design your own plan here (https://www.crfb.org/socialsecurityreformer/)). Goldwein argued that raising the retirement age should be a part of this solution.</p>
<p>According to the program’s chief actuary (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/retireage_summary.html), simply indexing the retirement age for longevity – so workers have a constant ratio of years in work to retirement – would close one-fifth of Social Security’s solvency gap and two-fifths of its structural gap. Under that framework, the retirement age would reach 69 for those retiring around 2075. A faster phase-in could generate further solvency improvements, while a well-designed poverty protection benefit (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform) could protect lower-income seniors.
Options to Raise the Social Security Age</p>
<p>Proposal
% of Solvency Gap Closed
% of 75th Year Gap Closed</p>
<p>Raise normal retirement age (NRA) from 67 to 68 (1 mo/2 yrs)
12%
16%</p>
<p>Index NRA to life expectancy (1 mo/2yrs)*
19%
40%</p>
<p>Raise NRA to 69 (2 mo/yr), then index (1 mo/2 yrs)
38%
57%</p>
<p>Raise EEA from 62 to 64 and NRA from 67 to 69 (3 mo/yr)
25%
25%</p>
<p>Raise ages by one year then index, count all years of work equally toward benefits, establish an age 62 poverty protection benefit
15%
25%</p>
<p>Sources: Social Security Office of Chief Actuary, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. *This would maintain constant ratio of years in work to retirement, so years in work and retirement could both grow.</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would boost economic growth (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform), mainly by promoting delayed retirement for those who are able. Although workers are eligible for benefits before the full retirement age and can claim benefits without retiring, the official age nonetheless sends powerful signals for when workers should retire. Indeed, age 67 is the second most popular age in which workers retire, after the earliest eligibility age of 62.</p>
<p>Raising either the early or full age would lead some workers to extend their careers as life expectancy rises, and this additional work would lead to higher output. Based on estimates (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf) from CBO, every one-year increase in the full retirement age would result in nearly three months (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12) of additional work, boosting the size of the labor force and the economy by about 0.5 percent (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12). Raising the earliest age would generate an even stronger effect. Other groups have estimated even larger effects (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=33).</p>
<p>Continued work resulting from changes in retirement signals can also enhance the well-being of seniors themselves. For example, each additional year of work is estimated to increase wealth by 5 percent and retirement income by about 10 percent (https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement). The choice to delay retirement also appears to result in better health (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/retirement/working-longer-may-benefit-your-health.html), stronger social networks (https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wp_2016-15.pdf), lower rates of mortality (https://crr.bc.edu/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/#:~:text=Working%20longer%20is%20associated%20with,in%20ordinary%20linear%20regression%20models.), and other benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-against-early-retirement-11555899000) that improve overall welfare and happiness.</p>
<p>To be sure, the choice to raise the retirement age is not without its trade-offs. As Ghilarducci alluded to in her debate with Goldwein, each one-year increase in the NRA would be the equivalent of a 5 to 6.5 percent reduction in lifetime benefits for most retirees (excluding those with disabilities and many widow(er)s), and there are numerous barriers to employment for older workers. But the Trustees project (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=162) real (inflation-adjusted) initial benefits to roughly triple over the next 75 years, while average life expectancy grows by about four years (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=107) – meaning phasing in a three-year increase in the retirement age will only modestly slow the scheduled expansion of benefits.</p>
<p>Goldwein and Ghilarducci also agreed on the need for better policies to reduce employer discrimination and support older workers, and Goldwein went further by calling for a broader rethink of retirement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibn8l64j_-0) culture – going toward a system that allows and encourages retirement flexibility (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/managed/media-documents2022-02/Chartbook_Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=14).</p></div>]]></description>

<div><strong>The Case for Raising the Social Security Retirement Age</strong> <small>2023-07-26 17:39:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s Marc Goldwein recently appeared (https://t.co/NBUNqfw6vV) on the “Open to Debate” podcast to discuss the benefits of raising the Social Security retirement age. Taking the other position was Teresa Ghilarducci, Professor of Economics and Policy Analysis at The New School for Social Research.</p>
<p>In the debate, Goldwein explained that:</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would strengthen Social Security solvency, helping to avoid a 23 percent across-the-board benefit cut in just a decade.
 Raising the retirement age would accelerate economic growth by encouraging more work and savings and signaling some workers to delay their retirement.
 More flexible and delayed retirement can enhance the wellbeing of seniors, boosting their financial wealth, mental and physical health, and overall happiness</p>
<p>Social Security’s normal retirement age (NRA), also called the full retirement age, is currently 67 – though seniors can claim an early eligibility age (EEA) as soon as age 62 or as late as age 70, with monthly benefits adjusted upward or downward depending on collection age.</p>
<p>Under the latest Trustees projections (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/social-security-and-medicare-trustees-release-2023-reports), Social Security’s Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run out of reserves (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) by 2033, when today’s 57-year-olds reach the normal retirement age and today’s youngest retirees turn 72. At that point the law calls for an immediate 23 percent (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/TR/2023/II_E_conclu.html#86802) across-the-board benefit cut.</p>
<p>Restoring solvency to Social Security will likely require a combination of higher revenue (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/ways-and-means-hold-hearing-social-security-2100-act) and slower benefit growth (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/are-social-security-benefits-modest) (design your own plan here (https://www.crfb.org/socialsecurityreformer/)). Goldwein argued that raising the retirement age should be a part of this solution.</p>
<p>According to the program’s chief actuary (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/solvency/provisions/retireage_summary.html), simply indexing the retirement age for longevity – so workers have a constant ratio of years in work to retirement – would close one-fifth of Social Security’s solvency gap and two-fifths of its structural gap. Under that framework, the retirement age would reach 69 for those retiring around 2075. A faster phase-in could generate further solvency improvements, while a well-designed poverty protection benefit (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform) could protect lower-income seniors.
Options to Raise the Social Security Age</p>
<p>Proposal
% of Solvency Gap Closed
% of 75th Year Gap Closed</p>
<p>Raise normal retirement age (NRA) from 67 to 68 (1 mo/2 yrs)
12%
16%</p>
<p>Index NRA to life expectancy (1 mo/2yrs)*
19%
40%</p>
<p>Raise NRA to 69 (2 mo/yr), then index (1 mo/2 yrs)
38%
57%</p>
<p>Raise EEA from 62 to 64 and NRA from 67 to 69 (3 mo/yr)
25%
25%</p>
<p>Raise ages by one year then index, count all years of work equally toward benefits, establish an age 62 poverty protection benefit
15%
25%</p>
<p>Sources: Social Security Office of Chief Actuary, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. *This would maintain constant ratio of years in work to retirement, so years in work and retirement could both grow.</p>
<p>Raising the retirement age would boost economic growth (https://www.crfb.org/papers/promoting-economic-growth-through-social-security-reform), mainly by promoting delayed retirement for those who are able. Although workers are eligible for benefits before the full retirement age and can claim benefits without retiring, the official age nonetheless sends powerful signals for when workers should retire. Indeed, age 67 is the second most popular age in which workers retire, after the earliest eligibility age of 62.</p>
<p>Raising either the early or full age would lead some workers to extend their careers as life expectancy rises, and this additional work would lead to higher output. Based on estimates (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf) from CBO, every one-year increase in the full retirement age would result in nearly three months (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12) of additional work, boosting the size of the labor force and the economy by about 0.5 percent (https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/112th-congress-2011-2012/reports/01-10-2012-Medicare_SS_EligibilityAgesBrief.pdf#page=12). Raising the earliest age would generate an even stronger effect. Other groups have estimated even larger effects (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=33).</p>
<p>Continued work resulting from changes in retirement signals can also enhance the well-being of seniors themselves. For example, each additional year of work is estimated to increase wealth by 5 percent and retirement income by about 10 percent (https://www.urban.org/research/publication/working-good-retirement). The choice to delay retirement also appears to result in better health (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/retirement/working-longer-may-benefit-your-health.html), stronger social networks (https://crr.bc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wp_2016-15.pdf), lower rates of mortality (https://crr.bc.edu/how-does-delayed-retirement-affect-mortality-and-health/#:~:text=Working%20longer%20is%20associated%20with,in%20ordinary%20linear%20regression%20models.), and other benefits (https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-against-early-retirement-11555899000) that improve overall welfare and happiness.</p>
<p>To be sure, the choice to raise the retirement age is not without its trade-offs. As Ghilarducci alluded to in her debate with Goldwein, each one-year increase in the NRA would be the equivalent of a 5 to 6.5 percent reduction in lifetime benefits for most retirees (excluding those with disabilities and many widow(er)s), and there are numerous barriers to employment for older workers. But the Trustees project (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=162) real (inflation-adjusted) initial benefits to roughly triple over the next 75 years, while average life expectancy grows by about four years (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2023/tr2023.pdf#page=107) – meaning phasing in a three-year increase in the retirement age will only modestly slow the scheduled expansion of benefits.</p>
<p>Goldwein and Ghilarducci also agreed on the need for better policies to reduce employer discrimination and support older workers, and Goldwein went further by calling for a broader rethink of retirement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibn8l64j_-0) culture – going toward a system that allows and encourages retirement flexibility (https://www.crfb.org/sites/default/files/managed/media-documents2022-02/Chartbook_Promoting_Economic_Growth_through_Social_Security_Reform.pdf#page=14).</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Benjamin Netanyahu is the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history. After five elections happening in four years, Israeli voters re-elected him in November 2022 where he established a new government while on trial for corruption charges he was indicted for in 2019. Since then, he has introduced plans for judiciary reforms allowing Israel’s Parliament to overrule Supreme Court decisions by a one-vote majority and giving the government the power to appoint judges — which has led to large-scale public protests throughout Israel. Supporters welcome his tough stance on Iran and argue the changes are needed to better balance the power between lawmakers and judges and bring Israel’s judiciary system closer to other Western countries.

In Texas, school administrators restricted access to more than 800 books in 22 districts over concerns about whether they were considered “developmentally appropriate for student use.” Similar actions were carried out in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. In fact, all across the country school administrators are grappling with new pressures concerning what their students are reading and how they are taught. At its core is the fundamental question of whether some books are beyond reproach. Those who say “yes” argue that children should not be exposed to sex, violence, drug use, or other inappropriate topics. Further, they argue, keeping such books out of public libraries does not prevent students from accessing these books elsewhere. Others say that removing books is inherently un-American, and that reading controversial books fosters critical thinking, encourages empathy, and provides a more diverse understanding of the world.

<p><span class="TextRun SCXO236537465 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO236537465 BCX0">In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis passed a state education reform package meant to restrict certain books and how gender, sexuality, and race are taught in public schools. In Texas, school administrators restricted access to more than 800 books in 22 districts over concerns about whether they were considered “developmentally appropriate for student use.” Similar actions were carried out in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. In fact, all across the country school administrators are grappling with new pressures concerning what their students are reading and how they are taught. At its core is the fundamental question of whether some books are beyond reproach. Those who say “yes” argue that children should not be exposed to sex, violence, drug use, or other inappropriate topics. Further, they argue, keeping such books out of public libraries does not prevent students from accessing these books elsewhere. Others say that removing books is inherently un-American, and that reading controversial books fosters critical thinking, encourages empathy, and provides a more diverse understanding of the world. It is in this context that we debate the following question: Should Certain Books Ever be Banned in School?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXO236537465 BCX0"> </span>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Energy, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXO45731932 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO45731932 BCX0">When it comes to carbon dioxide, last year was a record year. The world emitted more of the climate-warming gas in 2022 than in any year since scientists began recording levels in 1900. The culprit, says the International Energy Agency, is society’s voracious appetite for fossil fuels, and the need to burn them. So … what can be done to prevent dangerous levels of warming? One potential method is called carbon capture and storage, a technology in which CO2 is extracted and stored in underground facilities. In fact, as recently as February, Exxon Mobil announced that it will use Honeywell technology in Texas to capture some seven million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Other companies, meanwhile, have followed suit. But it is not without controversy. Critics say the technology is not cost effective, is unreliable in large scales, and that the level of carbon removal needed to help the planet is well beyond current capacity.

<p><span class="TextRun SCXO45731932 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO45731932 BCX0">When it comes to carbon dioxide, last year was a record year. The world emitted more of the climate-warming gas in 2022 than in any year since scientists began recording levels in 1900. The culprit, says the International Energy Agency, is society’s voracious appetite for fossil fuels, and the need to burn them. So … what can be done to prevent dangerous levels of warming? One potential method is called carbon capture and storage, a technology in which CO2 is extracted and stored in underground facilities. In fact, as recently as February, Exxon Mobil announced that it will use Honeywell technology in Texas to capture some seven million tons of carbon dioxide per year. Other companies, meanwhile, have followed suit. But it is not without controversy. Critics say the technology is not cost effective, is unreliable in large scales, and that the level of carbon removal needed to help the planet is well beyond current capacity. As such, they say, it is a dangerous distraction in the broader fight against climate change, potentially diluting the urgency in reducing emissions. Others say these systems are ever more adept at capturing gases from the air, and that they have the potential to become a critical tool in the battle against rising emissions.

<p>Last year was a banner year for those trading the New York chill for the Florida sun. Thirty-nine percent of Empire Staters packed up and moved to the Sunshine State, more than any year in history. In fact, recent census data revealed 1.6 million former New Yorkers (or 8% of Florida’s total population) now call Florida home — and it’s not just retirees.  Favorable tax policies are fueling Florida’s popularity, attracting<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>top businesses,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>budding entrepreneurs,<span class="apple-converted-space"><b> </b></span>and so-called one-percenters, such as Donald Trump and Carl Icahn.

Those who argue “yes” say<span class="apple-converted-space"><b> </b></span>New Yorkers are heading south where their money can last longer, their health can benefit from warmer climates, and their sense of safety can markedly improve. Others say that ‘blue state’ policies are a better choice in the long run and that as the effects of the pandemic recede, New York will once again rise in popularity. They also say the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>state’s inclusive practices and cultural diversity will<span class="apple-converted-space"><b> </b></span>pull people back to New York.

<div><strong>De Blasio’s Victory in New York vs. Florida Debate Is a Wake-Up Call for Conservatives</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:24:53</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>‘Florida is choosing the path of burning books,’ the ex-mayor says in painting the Sunshine State as a MAGA-fueled dystopia.</p>
<p>On April 28, a debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) between the Democratic former mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, and the Manhattan Institute’s president, Reihan Salam, will be released. Having watched the taping, I can say it’s a much-watch for liberals and conservatives alike for very different reasons.</p>
<p>I expected Mr. DeBlasio, with a governing record to defend, to be the underdog on the question, “Is Florida Eating New York’s Lunch?” The more than 1.6 million former New Yorkers who now call the Sunshine State home would seem to disprove his side of the argument.</p>
<p>The Census shows more New Yorkers relocated to Florida in 2022 than in any year since it joined the union in 1845. New York also has, at almost 10 percent, the highest income tax in the nation, while Florida has none.</p>
<p>The facts, figures, and comparisons of legal and regulatory climates all favored Mr. Salam, so liberals will enjoy seeing Mr. De Blasio prevail. Still, conservatives would do well to watch, not to suffer, but to see just what they’re up against in the arena of ideas.</p>
<p>The debate to be shared on public radio, video, and the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast was hosted by the non-partisan Open to Debate group, whose mission is to address “the extreme polarization of our nation and our politics.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salam, like many on the right, seemed to interpret avoiding “extreme polarization” as refusing to punch or even block. This posture was striking since he used to be the executive editor of William F. Buckley’s National Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley earned universal praise for his geniality yet never let anyone run roughshod over him. Even when confronting radicals and racists as the host of “Firing Line,” he never showed his belly, marshaling intelligence and humor to lay out the strongest possible case.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio, too, has core beliefs. He was unafraid to launch haymakers and score some hits below the belt. Even when the moderator, John Donvan, stepped in to defend Mr. Salam, the mayor would go right on flogging straw dogs.</p>
<p>Like “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” from the Jim Croce song, Mr. De Blasio concealed a razor in his shoe and used it to carve up Mr. Salam with such skill, that the man seemed not to notice until he grew woozy.</p>
<p>It was like watching a pitcher on a team I don’t root for throw a perfect game. “Why can’t our guy whip a fastball like that?” Mr. De Blasio pulled off the upset because while Mr. Salam aimed for viewers’ brains, Mr. De Blasio zeroed in on their hearts, painting Florida as an intolerant, dystopian hellscape dominated by “MAGA extremism.”</p>
<p>Florida is choosing a path of banning books, Mr. De Blasio said, and disallowing a woman’s right to choose. Florida’s turning against trans youth. Despite the state having larger black and Hispanic populations, he said it was hostile to diversity.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also warned as the Democratic senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did in 1969 that Florida would soon be underwater due to greenhouse gas, and heralded the Empire State’s social spending while sidestepping that its unsustainable deficit is the nation’s largest.</p>
<p>When I factor in pre-K for my child, Mr. De Blasio said, quoting a new arrival from Seattle, my cost of living is actually cheaper. I could almost hear the picture of Thomas Sowell in the book behind Mr. Salam screaming that this is tempting people to New York on the promise the state will give them cash stolen from their neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also touted his city’s rent control and $15 minimum wage. Conservatives used to have answers for these subjects: If rent control works, why does Gotham have the highest rent in the country? What about the minimum wage pricing out entry-level jobs, etc.?</p>
<p>The left ought to watch this debate to exalt victory and the right to relearn the lesson of the 2022 midterms that statistics won’t win elections for them, and until they learn to wield the rhetorical razor once more, the left is going to go right on charging lunch to their tabs.</p></div>
<div><strong>De Blasio slams Florida in online debate</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:35:32</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>'The future unfortunately is not bright for Florida' the former mayor said, regarding climate change.
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disavowed Marxism Friday afternoon, declaring that New York City’s inclusive politics far outweighed whatever advantages of climate or affordability the state of Florida may have. Unless you happen to take a Marxian perspective here, you can’t just talk about economics. You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well,” he said. “Florida has some strengths. But Florida is rapidly and aggressively undermining those strengths.”</p>
<p>De Blasio put himself in the debate chair to defend his city on a livestream (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to civil discourse. He took on Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute on the question: “Is Florida eating New York’s lunch?”</p>
<p>Now a visiting professor (https://nyunews.com/news/2023/04/11/bill-de-blasio-speaks-at-wagner/) at NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, de Blasio sat there while Salam slammed him, indirectly, on the city’s cost of living, ability to educate its students, retain public employees including police and teachers, and argued that working class people were leaving in search of affordability.</p>
<p>De Blasio, in turn, criticized Florida’s politics, including Gov. Ron DeSantis’ law banning abortion (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/13/florida-6-week-abortion-ban-bill-00091965) after six weeks and the “Don’t Say Gay” law. (https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d) The current mayor, Eric Adams, has found DeSantis’ conservative politics to be an easy target too, and backed an ad campaign (https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/04/nyc-fires-back-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-billboard-counter-attack/363992/) telling LGTBQ Floridians and their allies to come to New York.</p>
<p>In a somewhat morbid closing argument, de Blasio invoked the threat of climate change to argue that New York will ultimately prevail in the rivalry. “The future, unfortunately, is not bright for Florida,” he said. “The human made threats coming out of their state government are bad enough, and will hinder Florida’s economic and social future. But the threat from mother nature is so much greater.”</p></div>
<div><strong>Bill de Blasio Argues Against ‘Marxian Analysis’ of NYC’s Affordability Crisis</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:41:23</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The former "communist mayor" brags about millionaires, and more links to start your day.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, while everyone else was out basking in the freakish warmth of a summer day in spring, the 109th mayor of New York City put on a suit, sat in front of a microphone, and attempted to defend our honor.</p>
<p>Bill de Blasio had agreed to tape an episode of the Open to Debate podcast (https://opentodebate.org/). The question at hand: Is Florida eating New York's lunch? Reihan Salam, the president of the Manhattan Institute, entered the Zoom room to argue in the affirmative, but both men soon discovered that this vague prompt was kind of stupid.</p>
<p>No one was here to argue that Florida living was better than New York's, not even the guy who was supposed to make that point. They're too different (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-14/three-years-into-the-pandemic-the-urban-exodus-was-overblown?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy). "Floridians can just hop in their SUVs. I personally prefer the New York way of life," Salam admitted. And essentially, everyone agreed that Florida was rapidly becoming a place that excludes women (https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-approved-c9c53311a0b2426adc4b8d0b463edad1), the LGBTQ community (https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis), immigrants (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/migrants-marthas-vineyard-desantis-texas.html), and people who are squeamish about banning books (https://pen.org/banned-books-florida/). "Florida is a place that a lot of smart, creative, entrepreneurial people are going to say, 'This isn't for me anymore,'" de Blasio declared.</p>
<p>The debate got interesting when Salam raised a point that de Blasio seemingly had no answer to: New York is becoming impossibly unaffordable to everyone but the rich and extremely rich.</p>
<p>We're really losing strivers. We're really losing working- and middle-class people. What's happening is the gentrification of New York, Salam said.</p>
<p>"Now, you can't just, you know, unless you happen to take a Marxian analysis here, you can't just talk about economics," de Blasio said. "You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well."</p>
<p>If you had experienced the eight years of Bill and were still watching the debate, you were screaming at your screen. What's that, Mr. Tale of Two Cities (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_zMTrhgAw)? Mr. Free Pre-K for All (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/09/bill-de-blasios-prek-crusade/498830/)? You can't just look at the economics?</p>
<p>De Blasio could have admitted that yes, NYC was too expensive, and yes, he had done his best but failed to fully turn things around, but that New York still has the legislative ability to make deep and enduring changes on the economic front while maintaining its cultural capital, and he could have pointed to legislation in Albany that would protect tenants and make things more affordable for lower-income New Yorkers, and on and on.</p>
<p>But that would have required a self-awareness that still somehow eludes de Blasio in his public appearances. So instead, he made noises about "opportunity" and pointed to the existence of rent-stabilized apartments and NYCHA buildings as proof that New York was going to be just fine.</p>
<p>In the end, you had the Manhattan Institute guy complaining about the length of the NYCHA waitlist, and Bill fucking de Blasio, the guy the right-wing media spent years painting as a straight-up communist, bragging about how New York increased its number of millionaires (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/nyregion/millionaires-new-york-taxes.html).</p>
<p>Nearly one hour into the debate, some journalists were allowed to come on to ask a question both the Times and Politico asked de Blasio what they thought of Mayor Eric Adams's stated intention to stop the expansion (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/nyregion/prekindergarten-adams-nyc-3k.html) of 3-K for all, and both times, de Blasio failed to stand up for his program Classic.</p>
<p>I've heard many times, including direct conversations with Mayor Adams, that he said how much he is committed to early childhood education. And until the budget is resolved between him and the Council, it's impossible to say what the final investments will be made, de Blasio said.</p>

<p>Last year was a banner year for those trading the New York chill for the Florida sun. Thirty-nine percent of Empire Staters packed up and moved to the Sunshine State, more than any year in history. In fact, recent census data revealed 1.6 million former New Yorkers (or 8% of Florida’s total population) now call Florida home — and it’s not just retirees.  Favorable tax policies are fueling Florida’s popularity, attracting<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>top businesses,<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>budding entrepreneurs,<span class="apple-converted-space"><b> </b></span>and so-called one-percenters, such as Donald Trump and Carl Icahn.

They also say the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>state’s inclusive practices and cultural diversity will<span class="apple-converted-space"><b> </b></span>pull people back to New York.

<div><strong>De Blasio’s Victory in New York vs. Florida Debate Is a Wake-Up Call for Conservatives</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:24:53</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>‘Florida is choosing the path of burning books,’ the ex-mayor says in painting the Sunshine State as a MAGA-fueled dystopia.</p>
<p>On April 28, a debate (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) between the Democratic former mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, and the Manhattan Institute’s president, Reihan Salam, will be released. Having watched the taping, I can say it’s a much-watch for liberals and conservatives alike for very different reasons.</p>
<p>I expected Mr. DeBlasio, with a governing record to defend, to be the underdog on the question, “Is Florida Eating New York’s Lunch?” The more than 1.6 million former New Yorkers who now call the Sunshine State home would seem to disprove his side of the argument.</p>
<p>The Census shows more New Yorkers relocated to Florida in 2022 than in any year since it joined the union in 1845. New York also has, at almost 10 percent, the highest income tax in the nation, while Florida has none.</p>
<p>The facts, figures, and comparisons of legal and regulatory climates all favored Mr. Salam, so liberals will enjoy seeing Mr. De Blasio prevail. Still, conservatives would do well to watch, not to suffer, but to see just what they’re up against in the arena of ideas.</p>
<p>The debate to be shared on public radio, video, and the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast was hosted by the non-partisan Open to Debate group, whose mission is to address “the extreme polarization of our nation and our politics.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salam, like many on the right, seemed to interpret avoiding “extreme polarization” as refusing to punch or even block. This posture was striking since he used to be the executive editor of William F. Buckley’s National Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckley earned universal praise for his geniality yet never let anyone run roughshod over him. Even when confronting radicals and racists as the host of “Firing Line,” he never showed his belly, marshaling intelligence and humor to lay out the strongest possible case.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio, too, has core beliefs. He was unafraid to launch haymakers and score some hits below the belt. Even when the moderator, John Donvan, stepped in to defend Mr. Salam, the mayor would go right on flogging straw dogs.</p>
<p>Like “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” from the Jim Croce song, Mr. De Blasio concealed a razor in his shoe and used it to carve up Mr. Salam with such skill, that the man seemed not to notice until he grew woozy.</p>
<p>It was like watching a pitcher on a team I don’t root for throw a perfect game. “Why can’t our guy whip a fastball like that?” Mr. De Blasio pulled off the upset because while Mr. Salam aimed for viewers’ brains, Mr. De Blasio zeroed in on their hearts, painting Florida as an intolerant, dystopian hellscape dominated by “MAGA extremism.”</p>
<p>Florida is choosing a path of banning books, Mr. De Blasio said, and disallowing a woman’s right to choose. Florida’s turning against trans youth. Despite the state having larger black and Hispanic populations, he said it was hostile to diversity.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also warned as the Democratic senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan did in 1969 that Florida would soon be underwater due to greenhouse gas, and heralded the Empire State’s social spending while sidestepping that its unsustainable deficit is the nation’s largest.</p>
<p>When I factor in pre-K for my child, Mr. De Blasio said, quoting a new arrival from Seattle, my cost of living is actually cheaper. I could almost hear the picture of Thomas Sowell in the book behind Mr. Salam screaming that this is tempting people to New York on the promise the state will give them cash stolen from their neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio also touted his city’s rent control and $15 minimum wage. Conservatives used to have answers for these subjects: If rent control works, why does Gotham have the highest rent in the country? What about the minimum wage pricing out entry-level jobs, etc.?</p>
<p>The left ought to watch this debate to exalt victory and the right to relearn the lesson of the 2022 midterms that statistics won’t win elections for them, and until they learn to wield the rhetorical razor once more, the left is going to go right on charging lunch to their tabs.</p></div>
<div><strong>De Blasio slams Florida in online debate</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:35:32</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>'The future unfortunately is not bright for Florida' the former mayor said, regarding climate change.
Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio disavowed Marxism Friday afternoon, declaring that New York City’s inclusive politics far outweighed whatever advantages of climate or affordability the state of Florida may have. Unless you happen to take a Marxian perspective here, you can’t just talk about economics. You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well,” he said. “Florida has some strengths. But Florida is rapidly and aggressively undermining those strengths.”</p>
<p>De Blasio put himself in the debate chair to defend his city on a livestream (https://opentodebate.org/debate/is-florida-eating-new-yorks-lunch/) hosted by Open to Debate, a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to civil discourse. He took on Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute on the question: “Is Florida eating New York’s lunch?”</p>
<p>Now a visiting professor (https://nyunews.com/news/2023/04/11/bill-de-blasio-speaks-at-wagner/) at NYU’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, de Blasio sat there while Salam slammed him, indirectly, on the city’s cost of living, ability to educate its students, retain public employees including police and teachers, and argued that working class people were leaving in search of affordability.</p>
<p>De Blasio, in turn, criticized Florida’s politics, including Gov. Ron DeSantis’ law banning abortion (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/13/florida-6-week-abortion-ban-bill-00091965) after six weeks and the “Don’t Say Gay” law. (https://apnews.com/article/florida-dont-say-gay-law-signed-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624d) The current mayor, Eric Adams, has found DeSantis’ conservative politics to be an easy target too, and backed an ad campaign (https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2022/04/nyc-fires-back-floridas-dont-say-gay-bill-billboard-counter-attack/363992/) telling LGTBQ Floridians and their allies to come to New York.</p>
<p>In a somewhat morbid closing argument, de Blasio invoked the threat of climate change to argue that New York will ultimately prevail in the rivalry. “The future, unfortunately, is not bright for Florida,” he said. “The human made threats coming out of their state government are bad enough, and will hinder Florida’s economic and social future. But the threat from mother nature is so much greater.”</p></div>
<div><strong>Bill de Blasio Argues Against ‘Marxian Analysis’ of NYC’s Affordability Crisis</strong> <small>2023-04-19 21:41:23</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The former "communist mayor" brags about millionaires, and more links to start your day.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, while everyone else was out basking in the freakish warmth of a summer day in spring, the 109th mayor of New York City put on a suit, sat in front of a microphone, and attempted to defend our honor.</p>
<p>Bill de Blasio had agreed to tape an episode of the Open to Debate podcast (https://opentodebate.org/). The question at hand: Is Florida eating New York's lunch? Reihan Salam, the president of the Manhattan Institute, entered the Zoom room to argue in the affirmative, but both men soon discovered that this vague prompt was kind of stupid.</p>
<p>No one was here to argue that Florida living was better than New York's, not even the guy who was supposed to make that point. They're too different (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-14/three-years-into-the-pandemic-the-urban-exodus-was-overblown?utm_source=website&utm_medium=share&utm_campaign=copy). "Floridians can just hop in their SUVs. I personally prefer the New York way of life," Salam admitted. And essentially, everyone agreed that Florida was rapidly becoming a place that excludes women (https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-ban-approved-c9c53311a0b2426adc4b8d0b463edad1), the LGBTQ community (https://www.npr.org/2022/03/28/1089221657/dont-say-gay-florida-desantis), immigrants (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/us/migrants-marthas-vineyard-desantis-texas.html), and people who are squeamish about banning books (https://pen.org/banned-books-florida/). "Florida is a place that a lot of smart, creative, entrepreneurial people are going to say, 'This isn't for me anymore,'" de Blasio declared.</p>
<p>The debate got interesting when Salam raised a point that de Blasio seemingly had no answer to: New York is becoming impossibly unaffordable to everyone but the rich and extremely rich.</p>
<p>We're really losing strivers. We're really losing working- and middle-class people. What's happening is the gentrification of New York, Salam said.</p>
<p>"Now, you can't just, you know, unless you happen to take a Marxian analysis here, you can't just talk about economics," de Blasio said. "You have to talk about cultural and political factors as well."</p>
<p>If you had experienced the eight years of Bill and were still watching the debate, you were screaming at your screen. What's that, Mr. Tale of Two Cities (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH_zMTrhgAw)? Mr. Free Pre-K for All (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/09/bill-de-blasios-prek-crusade/498830/)? You can't just look at the economics?</p>
<p>De Blasio could have admitted that yes, NYC was too expensive, and yes, he had done his best but failed to fully turn things around, but that New York still has the legislative ability to make deep and enduring changes on the economic front while maintaining its cultural capital, and he could have pointed to legislation in Albany that would protect tenants and make things more affordable for lower-income New Yorkers, and on and on.</p>
<p>But that would have required a self-awareness that still somehow eludes de Blasio in his public appearances. So instead, he made noises about "opportunity" and pointed to the existence of rent-stabilized apartments and NYCHA buildings as proof that New York was going to be just fine.</p>
<p>In the end, you had the Manhattan Institute guy complaining about the length of the NYCHA waitlist, and Bill fucking de Blasio, the guy the right-wing media spent years painting as a straight-up communist, bragging about how New York increased its number of millionaires (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/nyregion/millionaires-new-york-taxes.html).</p>
<p>Nearly one hour into the debate, some journalists were allowed to come on to ask a question both the Times and Politico asked de Blasio what they thought of Mayor Eric Adams's stated intention to stop the expansion (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/nyregion/prekindergarten-adams-nyc-3k.html) of 3-K for all, and both times, de Blasio failed to stand up for his program Classic.</p>
<p>I've heard many times, including direct conversations with Mayor Adams, that he said how much he is committed to early childhood education. And until the budget is resolved between him and the Council, it's impossible to say what the final investments will be made, de Blasio said.</p>
<p>Will the former mayor find his footing or will he remain a hot take (https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-hot-take-bracket-goes-from-elite-eight-to-final-four)? Watch this space.</p></div>

As women’s participation in the labor force climbs, men are dropping out in record numbers. That rate has fallen more than 10 percentage points over the past half-century. Economists often point to a steady erosion of U.S. manufacturing jobs, largely brought on increased international competition, which became especially pronounced after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Women, by contrast, are not only enrolling and graduating from university in higher numbers but once they graduate, according to a 2018 McKinsey Report, they at times report negotiating for raises more than men. Meanwhile, men face higher levels of substance abuse, more overdoses, higher incarceration rates, lower life expectancies, and suicide levels that are nearly four times as high as women. They could use a hand, some say, lest these rates worsen. Not so, argue others. Yes, women are doing better professionally than they were in the past. But women still earn less than men, and hold fewer executive positions. The pay gap has narrowed, they acknowledge. But it’s still there. Women also routinely confront harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and elsewhere. There is still much to be done, they argue. Therein should reside society’s larger focus. It is in this context that we debate the following question:  Are Men Finished and Should We Help Them?</span></span>

As women’s participation in the labor force climbs, men are dropping out in record numbers. That rate has fallen more than 10 percentage points over the past half-century. Economists often point to a steady erosion of U.S. manufacturing jobs, largely brought on increased international competition, which became especially pronounced after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Women, by contrast, are not only enrolling and graduating from university in higher numbers but once they graduate, according to a 2018 McKinsey Report, they at times report negotiating for raises more than men. Meanwhile, men face higher levels of substance abuse, more overdoses, higher incarceration rates, lower life expectancies, and suicide levels that are nearly four times as high as women. They could use a hand, some say, lest these rates worsen. Not so, argue others. Yes, women are doing better professionally than they were in the past. But women still earn less than men, and hold fewer executive positions. The pay gap has narrowed, they acknowledge. But it’s still there. Women also routinely confront harassment and discrimination in the workplace, and elsewhere. There is still much to be done, they argue. Therein should reside society’s larger focus. It is in this context that we debate the following question:  Are Men Finished and Should We Help Them?</span></span>

The clauses are essentially contracts between employers and employees that prohibit the former from competing with the business after the employment has ended. As many as 30% of all U.S. private sector workers have signed such agreements, which actually find their roots all the way back in 15th century England. Those who defend such clauses say employers need these contracts to protect their investments in training workers, not to mention safeguarding their trade secrets.

These are but a few of the one-liners that have emanated from the liberal wing of the Democratic party in recent years. With the emergence of “The Squad” in 2018 – or what began as four Democratic congresswomen who sought to push their party further left – liberal lawmakers have grown more prevalent in recent election cycles. And with just a slim 51-49 Democrat majority in the Senate, progressives are now eyeing 2024 as a way to strengthen their broader influence. By doing so, some say, the party risks aligning itself with ever more extreme politics, alienating moderate voices, and straying from what made it successful in the past. When President Bill Clinton was in office, they note, only 25 percent of Democrats described themselves as liberal; another 25 percent called themselves conservative, while an overwhelming 48 percent were self-described moderates. The equating of liberalism with Democratic policies, they argue, is a recent and dangerous trend, which makes governing more difficult. Others argue that the party is finally poised to make good what constitutes the reemergence of the political left, long stymied by the compromising influence of Washington and beltway politics. What’s more, they argue, this renewed focus on issues such as race, climate, income inequality has not only begun to address in earnest issues once paid only superficial notice but is also electrifying the nation's progressive base in ways that can win elections. It is in this context that we debate the following question: </span></span><span class="TextRun MacChromeBold SCXO29837985 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO29837985 BCX0">Is The Democratic Party Too Far Left?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXO29837985 BCX0"> </span>

These are but a few of the one-liners that have emanated from the liberal wing of the Democratic party in recent years. With the emergence of “The Squad” in 2018 – or what began as four Democratic congresswomen who sought to push their party further left – liberal lawmakers have grown more prevalent in recent election cycles. And with just a slim 51-49 Democrat majority in the Senate, progressives are now eyeing 2024 as a way to strengthen their broader influence. By doing so, some say, the party risks aligning itself with ever more extreme politics, alienating moderate voices, and straying from what made it successful in the past. When President Bill Clinton was in office, they note, only 25 percent of Democrats described themselves as liberal; another 25 percent called themselves conservative, while an overwhelming 48 percent were self-described moderates. The equating of liberalism with Democratic policies, they argue, is a recent and dangerous trend, which makes governing more difficult. Others argue that the party is finally poised to make good what constitutes the reemergence of the political left, long stymied by the compromising influence of Washington and beltway politics. What’s more, they argue, this renewed focus on issues such as race, climate, income inequality has not only begun to address in earnest issues once paid only superficial notice but is also electrifying the nation's progressive base in ways that can win elections. It is in this context that we debate the following question: </span></span><span class="TextRun MacChromeBold SCXO29837985 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO29837985 BCX0">Is The Democratic Party Too Far Left?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXO29837985 BCX0"> </span>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sixty years ago, in the sweltering August heat of Washington D.C., the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his most iconic speech, and a defining moment of the civil rights movement. "I have a dream,” he said before a crowd of some 250,000 people, pressed up to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, “that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." It is a sentence that has been repeated countless times in classrooms and lecture halls. And yet recently, King's words are more actively being parsed and debated about the appropriate place of race in America. With disparities in wealth, education, employment, housing, mobility, health, and rates of incarceration, some argue that King – who spoke during a period of more open bigotry – would not have wanted a “color-blind” society within these lingering racial inequalities. A raised</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">consciousness plays an important role, they say, in recognizing and correcting such imbalances. Others argue that America has become overly concerned with race, to a level of obsession, pointing to things like critical race theory and diversity, equity, inclusion programs, which they fear could ultimately prove detrimental</span><b><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></b><span data-contrast="auto">to the nation’s more egalitarian aspirations. Further, they argue, notions of race are often too broad to be useful, while the fixation on it divides those who might otherwise find common ground.

<div><strong>TikTok: to ban or not to ban?</strong> <small>2023-03-03 19:05:33</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On February 17, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a debate. The question was: should the U.S. ban TikTok? Our reporter was there to question both speakers. Here’s what he found out.</p>
<p>The U.S. should ban Tiktok.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion at a public debate hosted by the company Intelligence Squared was Kori Schake, Director of Foreign and Defense Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, and former official on the National Security Council.</p>
<p>On the other side of the virtual aisle sat Milton L Mueller, a Professor of Cybersecurity Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and creator of theGlobal Internet Governance Academic (http://giga-net.org/)Network (GigaNet) (http://giga-net.org/), an international association of scholars.</p>
<p>The choice of these two figures reflects the two parallel (and rarely converging) trends in the discourse on Tiktok, to which both speakers adhered throughout the course of the session (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/): the technical details of how these software platforms operate, and the political rhetoric of the current everything-is-national-security paradigm.</p>
<p>The debate</p>
<p>Setting the parameters of the debate in her opening remarks, Schake laid out the stakes, boiling the issue down to two main concerns: first, that American user data is making its way to China; and second, that Tiktok could be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese government. And it is this second point that should be of primary concern, not least given Tiktok’s extraordinary reach — 1.53 billion globally, and just shy of 80 million monthly active users in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mueller argued that China is not exporting its propaganda via Tiktok, noting that while ByteDance (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/bytedance/) (Tiktok’s owner) does do this on its domestic platform Douyin, it doesn’t make sense to do so on Tiktok and if it did, it would be to no avail, as users do not want to see such content, so the algorithm would suppress it, leading to negligible impact.</p>
<p>This argument an appeal to Tiktok’s business interests echoes the testimony (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sacks%20Testimony.pdf) of Yale Senior Fellow Samm Sacks in May 2019 to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Despite agreeing that ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, she cited examples from Didi (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/didi-chuxing/), Alibaba (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/alibaba/), and Tencent (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/tencent/) to argue that many Chinese firms routinely push back against data requests from the government. In this vein, while Douyin might be obligated to promote Communist Party media on its platform just like any other domestic competitor, Tiktok operates in a different social media landscape where such tactics are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Schake combatted this by surveying recent developments. She recounted how FBI Director Chris Wray and his U.K. counterpart, MI5’s Ken McCallum, have both argued that Tiktok presents a threat to the national security of their respective nations, which led in part to the Federal ban on Tiktok for government-owned devices. Indeed, in the days since the debate took place, Politico has reported (https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-to-staff-dont-use-tiktok/) that the European Commission has also announced a similar ban, with the European Council and EU Parliament said to be following suit.</p>
<p>But John Donvan, who chaired the debate, noted that Kori Schake was effectively providing an argument to authority: in her own words, “I am not an expert on espionage or tech.” As such, she was channeling credible experts. However, as Mueller was quick to point out, for all his access to intelligence, Wray himself is not a technology specialist either. And as far as we can tell, neither is McCallum. What’s more, in all these cases, “concern” over Tiktok’s purported exposure to be manipulated to influence American discourse abounds, but the evidence is thinner, or at least knowledge of it in the public domain seems harder to come by.</p>
<p>Beyond the source code</p>
<p>I tried to pin Mueller down on this in the questions I put to the panelists: given that Tiktok’s recommendation algorithm is so complex often likened to a black box and given that China’s internet regulation guidelines are explicit about platforms promoting core socialist values, how can we know that Tiktok isn’t adhering to those guidelines in some way?</p>
<p>The answer I received was this: While we will likely learn little from analyzing the source code or the functioning of the algorithm from the back end, we can learn more by looking at its outputs. Go on Tiktok, scroll, search, and see what content gets pushed your way. The only way CCP propaganda would rise to the top, Mueller quipped, was if America’s youth had latent communist sympathies. And for now, they are making billions of dollars with the algorithm operating as it is why should they change it?</p>
<p>This is a compelling argument. However, it seemed somewhat naive as a caricature of how PRC propaganda might look, and how media influence operations work. While subtlety and nuance are not characterizations redolent of China’s Foreign Ministry announcements, influence campaigns rarely appear so clunky: you’re unlikely to see hammers and sickles in promoted content sympathetic to Beijing’s preferred candidates or critical of others.</p>
<p>Of course, while such content is well documented on Facebook, Twitter, and other American platforms, it is apparently understudied on TikTok. However, when I asked Schake whether this should be tackled in legislation regulating algorithms across all platforms, she said: I don’t know enough about the functioning of AI algorithms to be able to answer.</p>
<p>This highlights the lack of convergence that characterizes much of the broader debate on Tiktok in the U.S.: a lack of nuanced understanding of the nature of the risks that various technologies pose, because of a general lack of literacy on how these new technologies function.</p>
<p>A Sisyphean task</p>
<p>Experts broadly agree that we should be wary of TikTok: they have proven themselves untrustworthy on numerous occasions, most recently by having Beijing-based employees access (https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/12/22/tiktok-tracks-forbes-journalists-bytedance/) American user data to track journalists despite claiming that this was not possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two substantial problems with a ban remain: Financially, many American small business owners use TikTok as their main revenue source, and would be adversely affected by a ban and legally, there are constitutional challenges on free speech grounds.</p>
<p>For now, we await the recommendations of the two-year-long review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as well as further actions by the recently anointed Select Committee (https://www.congress.gov/committee/house-select-committee-on-the-strategic-competition-between-the-united-states-and-the-chinese-communist-party/hlzs00) on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, a Republican-majority group whose members are on record expressing hardline views on this issue. The remarks of Tiktok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew (周受子 Zhōu Shòuzǐ), who will appear before the U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23, will certainly be worth tuning in for.</p></div>

<div><strong>TikTok: to ban or not to ban?</strong> <small>2023-03-03 19:05:33</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On February 17, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a debate. The question was: should the U.S. ban TikTok? Our reporter was there to question both speakers. Here’s what he found out.</p>
<p>The U.S. should ban Tiktok.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion at a public debate hosted by the company Intelligence Squared was Kori Schake, Director of Foreign and Defense Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, and former official on the National Security Council.</p>
<p>On the other side of the virtual aisle sat Milton L Mueller, a Professor of Cybersecurity Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and creator of theGlobal Internet Governance Academic (http://giga-net.org/)Network (GigaNet) (http://giga-net.org/), an international association of scholars.</p>
<p>The choice of these two figures reflects the two parallel (and rarely converging) trends in the discourse on Tiktok, to which both speakers adhered throughout the course of the session (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/): the technical details of how these software platforms operate, and the political rhetoric of the current everything-is-national-security paradigm.</p>
<p>The debate</p>
<p>Setting the parameters of the debate in her opening remarks, Schake laid out the stakes, boiling the issue down to two main concerns: first, that American user data is making its way to China; and second, that Tiktok could be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese government. And it is this second point that should be of primary concern, not least given Tiktok’s extraordinary reach — 1.53 billion globally, and just shy of 80 million monthly active users in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mueller argued that China is not exporting its propaganda via Tiktok, noting that while ByteDance (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/bytedance/) (Tiktok’s owner) does do this on its domestic platform Douyin, it doesn’t make sense to do so on Tiktok and if it did, it would be to no avail, as users do not want to see such content, so the algorithm would suppress it, leading to negligible impact.</p>
<p>This argument an appeal to Tiktok’s business interests echoes the testimony (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sacks%20Testimony.pdf) of Yale Senior Fellow Samm Sacks in May 2019 to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Despite agreeing that ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, she cited examples from Didi (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/didi-chuxing/), Alibaba (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/alibaba/), and Tencent (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/tencent/) to argue that many Chinese firms routinely push back against data requests from the government. In this vein, while Douyin might be obligated to promote Communist Party media on its platform just like any other domestic competitor, Tiktok operates in a different social media landscape where such tactics are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Schake combatted this by surveying recent developments. She recounted how FBI Director Chris Wray and his U.K. counterpart, MI5’s Ken McCallum, have both argued that Tiktok presents a threat to the national security of their respective nations, which led in part to the Federal ban on Tiktok for government-owned devices. Indeed, in the days since the debate took place, Politico has reported (https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-to-staff-dont-use-tiktok/) that the European Commission has also announced a similar ban, with the European Council and EU Parliament said to be following suit.</p>
<p>But John Donvan, who chaired the debate, noted that Kori Schake was effectively providing an argument to authority: in her own words, “I am not an expert on espionage or tech.” As such, she was channeling credible experts. However, as Mueller was quick to point out, for all his access to intelligence, Wray himself is not a technology specialist either. And as far as we can tell, neither is McCallum. What’s more, in all these cases, “concern” over Tiktok’s purported exposure to be manipulated to influence American discourse abounds, but the evidence is thinner, or at least knowledge of it in the public domain seems harder to come by.</p>
<p>Beyond the source code</p>
<p>I tried to pin Mueller down on this in the questions I put to the panelists: given that Tiktok’s recommendation algorithm is so complex often likened to a black box and given that China’s internet regulation guidelines are explicit about platforms promoting core socialist values, how can we know that Tiktok isn’t adhering to those guidelines in some way?</p>
<p>The answer I received was this: While we will likely learn little from analyzing the source code or the functioning of the algorithm from the back end, we can learn more by looking at its outputs. Go on Tiktok, scroll, search, and see what content gets pushed your way. The only way CCP propaganda would rise to the top, Mueller quipped, was if America’s youth had latent communist sympathies. And for now, they are making billions of dollars with the algorithm operating as it is why should they change it?</p>
<p>This is a compelling argument. However, it seemed somewhat naive as a caricature of how PRC propaganda might look, and how media influence operations work. While subtlety and nuance are not characterizations redolent of China’s Foreign Ministry announcements, influence campaigns rarely appear so clunky: you’re unlikely to see hammers and sickles in promoted content sympathetic to Beijing’s preferred candidates or critical of others.</p>
<p>Of course, while such content is well documented on Facebook, Twitter, and other American platforms, it is apparently understudied on TikTok. However, when I asked Schake whether this should be tackled in legislation regulating algorithms across all platforms, she said: I don’t know enough about the functioning of AI algorithms to be able to answer.</p>
<p>This highlights the lack of convergence that characterizes much of the broader debate on Tiktok in the U.S.: a lack of nuanced understanding of the nature of the risks that various technologies pose, because of a general lack of literacy on how these new technologies function.</p>
<p>A Sisyphean task</p>
<p>Experts broadly agree that we should be wary of TikTok: they have proven themselves untrustworthy on numerous occasions, most recently by having Beijing-based employees access (https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/12/22/tiktok-tracks-forbes-journalists-bytedance/) American user data to track journalists despite claiming that this was not possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two substantial problems with a ban remain: Financially, many American small business owners use TikTok as their main revenue source, and would be adversely affected by a ban and legally, there are constitutional challenges on free speech grounds.</p>
<p>For now, we await the recommendations of the two-year-long review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as well as further actions by the recently anointed Select Committee (https://www.congress.gov/committee/house-select-committee-on-the-strategic-competition-between-the-united-states-and-the-chinese-communist-party/hlzs00) on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, a Republican-majority group whose members are on record expressing hardline views on this issue. The remarks of Tiktok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew (周受子 Zhōu Shòuzǐ), who will appear before the U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23, will certainly be worth tuning in for.</p></div>

<p><span data-contrast="none">With one billion active users across more than 150 countries, TikTok is by many measures one of the world’s most successful video apps — and half of Americans use it. The House of Representatives has passed a bill that could ban the social media company in the U.S. if its parent company, Bytedance, does not divest from it and requires TikTok to be bought by a country that is not a U.S. adversary. Those supporting such a move often point to a ban on another Chinese tech giant, Huawei, as an effective means of limiting China’s influence and bring up concerns the app could be used to leak Americans’ data to China for surveillance, making it a security risk. Those who argue against it say a ban would undermine what has become an important tool in the video marketplace, and that such efforts are not only politically motivated but are also easily bypassed. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"335559685":0}"> </span><span data-contrast="none">  </span><span data-ccp-props="{"335559685":0}"> </span>

<div><strong>Is TikTok a security threat? CT legislators ask for hard data on spying as ban considered</strong> <small>2023-03-16 18:28:03</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Government Administration and Elections Committee heard testimony (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXUHL0z8mpA) on a bill (https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/TOB/S/PDF/2023SB-01191-R00-SB.PDF) that would ban TikTok (https://www.ctinsider.com/politics/article/ct-legislature-considers-banning-tiktok-wechat-17771929.php) from being used by government employees or public officials on state-owned devices. The sole exception would be for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a member of Generation Z to know what TikTok is, said Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, during a Friday meeting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has repeatedly pointed out the danger that this application poses to government entities.</p>
<p>Rep. Gale Mastrofranceso, R-Southington, said, I gotta be honest with you, I'm on the fence on it.Do you have any data besides the news outlets? Do we have hard facts?</p>
<p>The proposed bill before the General Assembly would also charge the chief information officer, chief information security officer, and the chief court administrator to jointly develop security standards for computer programs and state-issued devices to counter cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>During the testimony, board members asked Duff and Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, if there was any concrete evidence about the espionage threat of TikTok.</p>
<p>I’m a freedom guy, as you know, said Sen. Rob Samson, R-Southington. Do you have any concrete evidence?”</p>
<p>Fazio replied The best example is that employees of ByteDance used TikTok geolocation data specifically to track journalists whom they suspected of speaking to employees of TikTok in the U.S. The ability of these applications to retain and collect data is immense.</p>
<p>In replies to requests for more data on the privacy threats of TikTok, Duff, and Fazio pointed to news reports about TikTok tracking journalists and the testimony of FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Jeff Brown, the current chief information security officer, and Mark Raymond, the chief information officer, asked the various intelligence and security agencies, including the FBI, for guidance on TikTok</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by CT Insider via a Freedom of Information request, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had no additional evidence to provide that TikTok was a security threat.</p>
<p>I asked one of my analysts to reach out to our HQ … She couldn’t find evidence that we had any additional information to share,” wrote FBI supervisory agent Connor Phoenix in an email to Connecticut officials. Sorry, we don’t have more to offer.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between what the cybersecurity agents could provide and what the FBI director is saying in public is likely political, says Milton Mueller, director of the Internet Governance Project of Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Chris Wray is not an expert on cybersecurity. The FBI director is a political appointee and he is touting a political line, Mueller said in an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate earlier this month. (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/) This is a foreign policy case. There are people who believe in decoupling from China, and they will interpret any connection to a Chinese company as a threat. There’s really no evidence that this is harming the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>MoveOn: No Labels’ “Shameful” Decision to Move Forward With Reckless Third-Party Bid Puts Democracy and Our Freedoms at Risk</strong> <small>2024-03-13 14:53:36</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Dark-money, Trump donor-funded No Labels Commits to Run Third-Party Presidential Ticket That Would Help Donald Trump Win a Second White House Term This November</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. – In response to news that No Labels has officially decided to move forward with a reckless third-party presidential ticket that will help Donald Trump get reelected, MoveOn Political Action Executive Director Rahna Epting released the following statement:</p>
<p>“The consequences of the next presidential election could not be more serious or more existential, and, despite this, No Labels has put their dangerous, reckless thought experiment ahead of the rights and freedoms of millions of Americans and the future of our democracy. Their decision to move forward with a dark-money, Trump donor-funded third-party fantasy bid is shameful and puts millions of Americans at risk.</p>
<p>“Their own founder said they are ‘not in it to win it,’ and several current and past supporters of No Labels have implored them to stand down. And yet, they have decided to pump millions of dollars of dark money into a run that would swing the election to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Any candidates who join the No Labels presidential ticket will be complicit in making it easier for Donald Trump and MAGA extremists to win a second term in the White House.”</p>
<p>Since writing an op-ed (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/04/no-labels-third-party-bid-dangerous/) in The Washington Post last spring, MoveOn has been campaigning against the dangers of No Labels in concert with Third Way. Epting appeared on NPR’s “Open to Debate” (https://opentodebate.org/debate/how-will-a-no-labels-presidential-candidate-change-the-outcome-in-2024-livestream-event/) against No Labels’ Ryan Clancy and spoke recently with USA Today (https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/03/06/2024-election-super-tuesday-third-party-no-labels-candidate/72852541007/) and The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/us/politics/biden-democrats-state-of-the-union.html) on the dangers of third parties this fall. Additionally, MoveOn launched ExposeNoLabels.com (http://exposenolabels.com/), called (https://apnews.com/article/maine-no-labels-party-petitions-confusion-eb01aa111be4da99f88ee4fb9f3b3bf2) on secretaries of state to monitor No Labels’ ballot access activities after voters in Maine were misled into changing their party affiliation status, and organized more than 85,000 people to sign a petition (https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/stop-no-labels-from-re-electing-trump?after_action=ssd3) calling for No Labels to step aside.</p></div>

<div><strong>TikTok: to ban or not to ban?</strong> <small>2023-03-03 19:05:33</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>On February 17, Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. hosted a debate. The question was: should the U.S. ban TikTok? Our reporter was there to question both speakers. Here’s what he found out.</p>
<p>The U.S. should ban Tiktok.</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion at a public debate hosted by the company Intelligence Squared was Kori Schake, Director of Foreign and Defense Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, and former official on the National Security Council.</p>
<p>On the other side of the virtual aisle sat Milton L Mueller, a Professor of Cybersecurity Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and creator of theGlobal Internet Governance Academic (http://giga-net.org/)Network (GigaNet) (http://giga-net.org/), an international association of scholars.</p>
<p>The choice of these two figures reflects the two parallel (and rarely converging) trends in the discourse on Tiktok, to which both speakers adhered throughout the course of the session (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/): the technical details of how these software platforms operate, and the political rhetoric of the current everything-is-national-security paradigm.</p>
<p>The debate</p>
<p>Setting the parameters of the debate in her opening remarks, Schake laid out the stakes, boiling the issue down to two main concerns: first, that American user data is making its way to China; and second, that Tiktok could be used as a propaganda tool by the Chinese government. And it is this second point that should be of primary concern, not least given Tiktok’s extraordinary reach — 1.53 billion globally, and just shy of 80 million monthly active users in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mueller argued that China is not exporting its propaganda via Tiktok, noting that while ByteDance (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/bytedance/) (Tiktok’s owner) does do this on its domestic platform Douyin, it doesn’t make sense to do so on Tiktok and if it did, it would be to no avail, as users do not want to see such content, so the algorithm would suppress it, leading to negligible impact.</p>
<p>This argument an appeal to Tiktok’s business interests echoes the testimony (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sacks%20Testimony.pdf) of Yale Senior Fellow Samm Sacks in May 2019 to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Despite agreeing that ultimately the Chinese government can compel companies to turn over their data, she cited examples from Didi (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/didi-chuxing/), Alibaba (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/alibaba/), and Tencent (https://thechinaproject.com/company-profiles/tencent/) to argue that many Chinese firms routinely push back against data requests from the government. In this vein, while Douyin might be obligated to promote Communist Party media on its platform just like any other domestic competitor, Tiktok operates in a different social media landscape where such tactics are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Schake combatted this by surveying recent developments. She recounted how FBI Director Chris Wray and his U.K. counterpart, MI5’s Ken McCallum, have both argued that Tiktok presents a threat to the national security of their respective nations, which led in part to the Federal ban on Tiktok for government-owned devices. Indeed, in the days since the debate took place, Politico has reported (https://www.politico.eu/article/european-commission-to-staff-dont-use-tiktok/) that the European Commission has also announced a similar ban, with the European Council and EU Parliament said to be following suit.</p>
<p>But John Donvan, who chaired the debate, noted that Kori Schake was effectively providing an argument to authority: in her own words, “I am not an expert on espionage or tech.” As such, she was channeling credible experts. However, as Mueller was quick to point out, for all his access to intelligence, Wray himself is not a technology specialist either. And as far as we can tell, neither is McCallum. What’s more, in all these cases, “concern” over Tiktok’s purported exposure to be manipulated to influence American discourse abounds, but the evidence is thinner, or at least knowledge of it in the public domain seems harder to come by.</p>
<p>Beyond the source code</p>
<p>I tried to pin Mueller down on this in the questions I put to the panelists: given that Tiktok’s recommendation algorithm is so complex often likened to a black box and given that China’s internet regulation guidelines are explicit about platforms promoting core socialist values, how can we know that Tiktok isn’t adhering to those guidelines in some way?</p>
<p>The answer I received was this: While we will likely learn little from analyzing the source code or the functioning of the algorithm from the back end, we can learn more by looking at its outputs. Go on Tiktok, scroll, search, and see what content gets pushed your way. The only way CCP propaganda would rise to the top, Mueller quipped, was if America’s youth had latent communist sympathies. And for now, they are making billions of dollars with the algorithm operating as it is why should they change it?</p>
<p>This is a compelling argument. However, it seemed somewhat naive as a caricature of how PRC propaganda might look, and how media influence operations work. While subtlety and nuance are not characterizations redolent of China’s Foreign Ministry announcements, influence campaigns rarely appear so clunky: you’re unlikely to see hammers and sickles in promoted content sympathetic to Beijing’s preferred candidates or critical of others.</p>
<p>Of course, while such content is well documented on Facebook, Twitter, and other American platforms, it is apparently understudied on TikTok. However, when I asked Schake whether this should be tackled in legislation regulating algorithms across all platforms, she said: I don’t know enough about the functioning of AI algorithms to be able to answer.</p>
<p>This highlights the lack of convergence that characterizes much of the broader debate on Tiktok in the U.S.: a lack of nuanced understanding of the nature of the risks that various technologies pose, because of a general lack of literacy on how these new technologies function.</p>
<p>A Sisyphean task</p>
<p>Experts broadly agree that we should be wary of TikTok: they have proven themselves untrustworthy on numerous occasions, most recently by having Beijing-based employees access (https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2022/12/22/tiktok-tracks-forbes-journalists-bytedance/) American user data to track journalists despite claiming that this was not possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two substantial problems with a ban remain: Financially, many American small business owners use TikTok as their main revenue source, and would be adversely affected by a ban and legally, there are constitutional challenges on free speech grounds.</p>
<p>For now, we await the recommendations of the two-year-long review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), as well as further actions by the recently anointed Select Committee (https://www.congress.gov/committee/house-select-committee-on-the-strategic-competition-between-the-united-states-and-the-chinese-communist-party/hlzs00) on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, a Republican-majority group whose members are on record expressing hardline views on this issue. The remarks of Tiktok’s CEO Shou Zi Chew (周受子 Zhōu Shòuzǐ), who will appear before the U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23, will certainly be worth tuning in for.</p></div>
<div><strong>Is TikTok a security threat? CT legislators ask for hard data on spying as ban considered</strong> <small>2023-03-16 18:28:03</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Government Administration and Elections Committee heard testimony (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXUHL0z8mpA) on a bill (https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/TOB/S/PDF/2023SB-01191-R00-SB.PDF) that would ban TikTok (https://www.ctinsider.com/politics/article/ct-legislature-considers-banning-tiktok-wechat-17771929.php) from being used by government employees or public officials on state-owned devices. The sole exception would be for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a member of Generation Z to know what TikTok is, said Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, during a Friday meeting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has repeatedly pointed out the danger that this application poses to government entities.</p>
<p>Rep. Gale Mastrofranceso, R-Southington, said, I gotta be honest with you, I'm on the fence on it.Do you have any data besides the news outlets? Do we have hard facts?</p>
<p>The proposed bill before the General Assembly would also charge the chief information officer, chief information security officer, and the chief court administrator to jointly develop security standards for computer programs and state-issued devices to counter cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>During the testimony, board members asked Duff and Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, if there was any concrete evidence about the espionage threat of TikTok.</p>
<p>I’m a freedom guy, as you know, said Sen. Rob Samson, R-Southington. Do you have any concrete evidence?”</p>
<p>Fazio replied The best example is that employees of ByteDance used TikTok geolocation data specifically to track journalists whom they suspected of speaking to employees of TikTok in the U.S. The ability of these applications to retain and collect data is immense.</p>
<p>In replies to requests for more data on the privacy threats of TikTok, Duff, and Fazio pointed to news reports about TikTok tracking journalists and the testimony of FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Jeff Brown, the current chief information security officer, and Mark Raymond, the chief information officer, asked the various intelligence and security agencies, including the FBI, for guidance on TikTok</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by CT Insider via a Freedom of Information request, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had no additional evidence to provide that TikTok was a security threat.</p>
<p>I asked one of my analysts to reach out to our HQ … She couldn’t find evidence that we had any additional information to share,” wrote FBI supervisory agent Connor Phoenix in an email to Connecticut officials. Sorry, we don’t have more to offer.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between what the cybersecurity agents could provide and what the FBI director is saying in public is likely political, says Milton Mueller, director of the Internet Governance Project of Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Chris Wray is not an expert on cybersecurity. The FBI director is a political appointee and he is touting a political line, Mueller said in an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate earlier this month. (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/) This is a foreign policy case. There are people who believe in decoupling from China, and they will interpret any connection to a Chinese company as a threat. There’s really no evidence that this is harming the United States.</p></div>
<div><strong>MoveOn: No Labels’ “Shameful” Decision to Move Forward With Reckless Third-Party Bid Puts Democracy and Our Freedoms at Risk</strong> <small>2024-03-13 14:53:36</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Dark-money, Trump donor-funded No Labels Commits to Run Third-Party Presidential Ticket That Would Help Donald Trump Win a Second White House Term This November</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. – In response to news that No Labels has officially decided to move forward with a reckless third-party presidential ticket that will help Donald Trump get reelected, MoveOn Political Action Executive Director Rahna Epting released the following statement:</p>
<p>“The consequences of the next presidential election could not be more serious or more existential, and, despite this, No Labels has put their dangerous, reckless thought experiment ahead of the rights and freedoms of millions of Americans and the future of our democracy. Their decision to move forward with a dark-money, Trump donor-funded third-party fantasy bid is shameful and puts millions of Americans at risk.</p>
<p>“Their own founder said they are ‘not in it to win it,’ and several current and past supporters of No Labels have implored them to stand down. And yet, they have decided to pump millions of dollars of dark money into a run that would swing the election to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Any candidates who join the No Labels presidential ticket will be complicit in making it easier for Donald Trump and MAGA extremists to win a second term in the White House.”</p>
<p>Since writing an op-ed (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/04/no-labels-third-party-bid-dangerous/) in The Washington Post last spring, MoveOn has been campaigning against the dangers of No Labels in concert with Third Way. Epting appeared on NPR’s “Open to Debate” (https://opentodebate.org/debate/how-will-a-no-labels-presidential-candidate-change-the-outcome-in-2024-livestream-event/) against No Labels’ Ryan Clancy and spoke recently with USA Today (https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/03/06/2024-election-super-tuesday-third-party-no-labels-candidate/72852541007/) and The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/us/politics/biden-democrats-state-of-the-union.html) on the dangers of third parties this fall. Additionally, MoveOn launched ExposeNoLabels.com (http://exposenolabels.com/), called (https://apnews.com/article/maine-no-labels-party-petitions-confusion-eb01aa111be4da99f88ee4fb9f3b3bf2) on secretaries of state to monitor No Labels’ ballot access activities after voters in Maine were misled into changing their party affiliation status, and organized more than 85,000 people to sign a petition (https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/stop-no-labels-from-re-electing-trump?after_action=ssd3) calling for No Labels to step aside.</p></div>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sexual violence is arguably the most devastating kind. And over the past few decades, the legal landscape has shifted to a more proactive stance. The Wetterling Act requires convicted offenders to register with local authorities. Megan’s Law mandates law enforcement to alert neighbors of those with past convictions in their community. And the U.S. Department of Justice consolidates convictions into a single, searchable site – all in the name of helping people avoid potential predators. But that registry has come under increasing scrutiny. Some suggest that it actually encourages further criminal offenses by making it virtually impossible for offenders to reintegrate into society. Crimes also vary considerably – from public urination, exhibitionists, and so-called “peeping Toms,” to more severe crimes, such as sexual assault and rape. Those differences, they say, are not adequately accounted for in the law. Others say that reducing such a proactive approach and tool will endanger communities, which have consistently supported it in the name of keeping communities safe.

Measured in purchasing power parity, it actually surpassed the U.S. economy in 2014, and has since expanded its military, monetary, infrastructure, and soft power capacities in ways that all seemed to point to long-term advantages as a rising power. At the Communist Party’s five-yearly congress in October 2022, Xi Jinping cemented his place as the country’s “helmsman” and its most powerful person since Mao Zedong, with an unprecedented third term as party chief. And yet the failure of China’s zero-COVID policy, a slumping economy, apparent supply chain vulnerabilities within its technology sector, and a problematic demographic profile have all raised questions about the scope of China’s future power. Those who say it has peaked say the Chinese system is facing significant economic headwinds, uneven innovation, a heavy debt burden, as well as mounting frustrations among its younger populations with regard to upward mobility and censorship. Those who say it hasn’t peaked argue that while the nation’s economic growth has indeed slowed, massive Chinese spending in infrastructure, defense, and technology will nonetheless allow it to enlarge its global power projections well into the future.

<div><strong>COUNTDOWN TO WAR China ‘learning from Putin’s Ukraine disaster’ as regime prepares for all-out Taiwan blitz to ‘cut island off from US’</strong> <small>2023-02-02 16:31:20</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA is preparing for an all-out blitz of Taiwan, a former US Department of Defence official has warned.</p>
<p>Michael Beckley said Xi Jinping (https://www.the-sun.com/who/xi-jinping/) will have learned from Putin's (https://www.the-sun.com/who/vladimir-putin/) disastrous mistakes in Ukraine (https://www.the-sun.com/where/ukraine/) and will aim to "hit Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/where/taiwan/) hard from the start" and "sever them from the outside world".</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also said China is "learning lessons" from Putin's invasion and warned: "What is happening in Europe today could happen in East Asia tomorrow."</p>
<p>China regards the self-governing island as part of its territory and has vowed to reunite it with the mainland (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Tensions between the two nations have hit boiling point (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6506796/china-us-worst-war-in-modern-history/) in recent months, with Beijing continuing to flex its military muscles (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5573864/chinas-live-fire-drills-taiwan-drones/) by launching jets into Taiwan's airspace (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5943706/taiwan-fighter-jets-china-invasion/) and firing missiles in haunting drills (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5958186/china-military-drills-taiwan/).</p>
<p>In November last year, the Chinese dictator ordered his troops to prepare for war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6628504/xi-orders-china-prepare-for-war/) - and some are predicting Beijing is "all but guaranteed" to attack Taiwan (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/).</p>
<p>In a chilling warning, Michael, who advises US intelligence agencies, said China's aggressive show of force is "not just for fun and games".</p>
<p>Speaking on the Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. podcast, the Associate Professor of Political Science at Tufts University said: "It's easy to say there won't be a war when we're sitting in New York. "If we were in Taipei, I would be a lot more nervous. "Peaceful unification options are disappearing very quickly for Beijing. Most Chinese scholars say Chinese leaders have been determined to snuff out Taiwan one way or another." We do have to be concerned that what China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games. "This is actual preparation for a conflict... I don't think it's super likely, but I worry we're too dismissive. These are nationalists who see it as making China whole again. "Xi Jinping has said the Taiwan issue cannot be passed down generation to generation. "A failed Chinese invasion of Taiwan will still kill a lot of people. "Can they win overall? Probably not. But can they deal the US a devastating blow from the outset? Yes."</p>
<p>Michael said it's possible Xi "might have commanders telling him it will be easy" to invade Taiwan. The defence expert said the Chinese army will have learned lessons from Putin's shambolic war in Ukraine. And like Putin, Michael said he "would expect Xi Jinping to rattle the nuclear sabre". "You just have to worry if pull comes to shove, Xi Jinping might just pull the trigger," he said. "With a dictator, you never know... there are factors that could bring this to a head very quickly. "It might not be a full-scale invasion - it might be economic meddling, political coercion."</p>
<p>"What China has been doing with the largest and most aggressive show of force is not just for fun and games"</p>
<p>– Michael BeckleyFormer US Department Of Defence Official</p>
<p>Taiwan is feared to be a major flashpoint between the Washington and Beijing (https://www.the-sun.com/news/3949232/us-secretly-training-taiwan-spy-missions-china/)- with a potential invasion forcing the US to either abandon the island or face full scale war with China (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5319135/china-invade-taiwan-new-aircraft-carrier/).</p>
<p>On Sunday, Republican Mike McCaul said the odds of conflict with China over Taiwan are "very high". He said if China failed to take control of Taiwan bloodlessly then "they are going to look at a military invasion in my judgement". It came after General Mike Minihan, head of the US Air Mobility Command, wrote in a memo: "My gut tells me we will fight in 2025."</p>
<p>Michael said the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond to China's vast military expansion. "They are coming off a decade of really ramping up their military capabilities - and the US and Taiwan have been slow to respond," he said. "As someone who works closely with the US government, I would like to have seen faster responses from Taiwan and Japan."</p>
<p>President and founder of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, said a war with Taiwan is "not very likely to happen in the next few years". But the author didn't rule out the scenario.</p>
<p>"China is going to be checked militarily by many countries in the region, and the US," Ian said. "The Chinese is aware of that, and they don't want to get in a direct fight militarily. "The Chinese aren't being stupid about trying to engage in a military confrontation with the US and their allies."</p>
<p>"Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that"</p>
<p>– Ian BremmerEurasia Group</p>
<p>He added: "Their ability to get Taiwanese business people to change their orientation politically or else they will be cut down is a lever the Chinese have. "Putin is a leader making massive misjudgements on the global stage - I don't see Xi doing that. "I don't see the Chinese government itching for a global fight - with the exception of the reunification of Taiwan." While Beijing may be preparing for a lightning war (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5946480/four-ways-china-take-taiwan-lightning-invasion/) to storm across the Taiwan Strait and capture the island, experts have said the war could be anything but quick. With tough beaches, rocky terrain, well-drilled defenders, and unforgiving seas, China could face the same brutal grinding warfare that Russia is facing in Ukraine. Taking Taiwan could even require Beijing to muster a force of two million troops (https://www.the-sun.com/news/5947970/china-two-million-soldiers-taiwan-russia/), it's been claimed.</p>
<p>Last year, new photos revealed for the first time (https://www.the-sun.com/news/6583901/heavy-military-operations-south-china-sea/) just how far China's militarisation has escalated in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Chilling images showed the massive sprawl of Chinese military operations on the man-made islands - which are armed to the teeth with deadly hardware including missile aircraft, flight hangars, and spy planes. The largest of the islands in the archipelago, Taiping Island, is currently controlled by Taiwan - which is at the centre of invasion plans being drawn up by Beijing.</p>

<div><strong>Up for debate: Would doing less in Ukraine help US prepare for China challenge?</strong> <small>2023-02-23 17:18:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA HAWKS SEEK SHIFT AWAY FROM UKRAINE: Just as Ukraine is facing a critical inflection point in what the Pentagon sees as a small window to break through Russian lines and reclaim the momentum in the yearlong war, there are Republicans in Congress who argue now is the time for the U.S. to scale back its support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Among those advocating a turn away from Ukraine is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is scheduled to deliver an address today at the Heritage Foundation, in which he will advocate a defense policy that prioritizes China as America’s biggest threat and “challenges the consensus on Ukraine.” The speech will focus on “key decisions America must make to deter China – including doing less in Ukraine,” according to a press release from his office.</p>
<p>“I want the Europeans on the continent there to do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Hawley told (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQNa2lHyAb0&t=78s) St. Louis television station KSDK last week. “Obviously I want to see Russia defeated …There's no doubt about any of that.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what are America's interests in the midst of this? Is our interest in nation-building in Ukraine? And by that I mean writing checks directly to the Ukrainian government,” Hawley said. “That's what we're doing and have been doing for months. What we should be doing is saying to the Europeans, Germany at the front of the list, you need to take the first priority, the lead in defending Ukraine and standing up to Russia. We will prioritize China.”</p>
<p>NATO DISCUSSES MAJOR INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING ACROSS ALLIANCE (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/defense-national-security/nato-major-increase-defense-spending)</p>
<p>THE ‘UKRAINE FATIGUE’ RESOLUTION: Hawley is in the minority in his party, but he’s not alone. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a resolution that would express to the House that it’s time to cut off U.S. assistance to Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,” the symbolic bill has no chance of enactment, but it did attract 10 hard-right cosponsors: Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Mary Miller (R-IL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).</p>
<p>The complaints about the high cost of U.S. aid come as a survey (https://apnorc.org/projects/acontinuing-support-for-u-s-involvement-a-year-into-the-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-a/) conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that while Americans still think the U.S. should play “at least some role in the war,” support for specific interventions like supplying weapons is “waning.”</p>
<p>MCCAUL: ‘THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE’: The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says many who are wavering on funding for Ukraine are concerned about how the money is being spent.</p>
<p>“You've got people in the fringe elements on both sides that are just dug in. You have a lot of people in the middle on my side of the aisle who are just being a little bit quiet to see how the winds blow because their big question is, ‘I just want to know where the money's gone,’” Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX) said in an interview with the Washington Examiner to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If I can explain that to them, and explain the accountability and the audits taking place … and then bring the Trump national security team in to say that this is the right foreign policy. I think those combined would go a long ways,” McCaul said. “What I want to do is basically be able to tell the story of where the money has gone. A third of it's gone into replenishing our stockpile and modernizing our weapon systems, a third is going to our defense contractors to make new weapons, which we really need, and then a third's going into Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“I mean, with less than 3% of our Department of Defense budget, they've annihilated the Russian military, they've humiliated them,” McCaul added. “Without one American soldier, which is key.”</p>

<div><strong>Up for debate: Would doing less in Ukraine help US prepare for China challenge?</strong> <small>2023-02-23 17:18:59</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CHINA HAWKS SEEK SHIFT AWAY FROM UKRAINE: Just as Ukraine is facing a critical inflection point in what the Pentagon sees as a small window to break through Russian lines and reclaim the momentum in the yearlong war, there are Republicans in Congress who argue now is the time for the U.S. to scale back its support to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Among those advocating a turn away from Ukraine is Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who is scheduled to deliver an address today at the Heritage Foundation, in which he will advocate a defense policy that prioritizes China as America’s biggest threat and “challenges the consensus on Ukraine.” The speech will focus on “key decisions America must make to deter China – including doing less in Ukraine,” according to a press release from his office.</p>
<p>“I want the Europeans on the continent there to do the heavy lifting when it comes to supporting Ukraine,” Hawley told (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQNa2lHyAb0&t=78s) St. Louis television station KSDK last week. “Obviously I want to see Russia defeated …There's no doubt about any of that.”</p>
<p>“The question is, what are America's interests in the midst of this? Is our interest in nation-building in Ukraine? And by that I mean writing checks directly to the Ukrainian government,” Hawley said. “That's what we're doing and have been doing for months. What we should be doing is saying to the Europeans, Germany at the front of the list, you need to take the first priority, the lead in defending Ukraine and standing up to Russia. We will prioritize China.”</p>
<p>NATO DISCUSSES MAJOR INCREASE IN DEFENSE SPENDING ACROSS ALLIANCE (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/defense-national-security/nato-major-increase-defense-spending)</p>
<p>THE ‘UKRAINE FATIGUE’ RESOLUTION: Hawley is in the minority in his party, but he’s not alone. Last week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) introduced a resolution that would express to the House that it’s time to cut off U.S. assistance to Ukraine’s war effort.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Ukraine Fatigue Resolution,” the symbolic bill has no chance of enactment, but it did attract 10 hard-right cosponsors: Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Mary Miller (R-IL), Barry Moore (R-AL), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT).</p>
<p>The complaints about the high cost of U.S. aid come as a survey (https://apnorc.org/projects/acontinuing-support-for-u-s-involvement-a-year-into-the-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-a/) conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that while Americans still think the U.S. should play “at least some role in the war,” support for specific interventions like supplying weapons is “waning.”</p>
<p>MCCAUL: ‘THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GONE’: The new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee says many who are wavering on funding for Ukraine are concerned about how the money is being spent.</p>
<p>“You've got people in the fringe elements on both sides that are just dug in. You have a lot of people in the middle on my side of the aisle who are just being a little bit quiet to see how the winds blow because their big question is, ‘I just want to know where the money's gone,’” Rep. Mike McCaul (R-TX) said in an interview with the Washington Examiner to be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If I can explain that to them, and explain the accountability and the audits taking place … and then bring the Trump national security team in to say that this is the right foreign policy. I think those combined would go a long ways,” McCaul said. “What I want to do is basically be able to tell the story of where the money has gone. A third of it's gone into replenishing our stockpile and modernizing our weapon systems, a third is going to our defense contractors to make new weapons, which we really need, and then a third's going into Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“I mean, with less than 3% of our Department of Defense budget, they've annihilated the Russian military, they've humiliated them,” McCaul added. “Without one American soldier, which is key.”</p>

<p><span class="normaltextrun">These days, the bird’s the word. Since shelling out $44 billion for Twitter, critics say Elon Musk is knocking the social media giant off its perch. Under his guidance, a slew of firings, a resurgence of unsavory Tweeters, and a bevy of on-again, off-again bans, have all raised questions about the platform’s long-term viability. Some investors have labeled Musk an albatross around Twitter’s neck, calling for him to stay focused on Tesla and SpaceX. Others say Musk is actually freeing the bird from anti-conservative censorship, which will engender more open discourse. His moves, they say, are all a part of a broader business acumen that has proven successful in the past. In that context, we ask the timely question of whether Elon Musk is killing Twitter.</span><span class="eop"> </span>

<div><strong>Is Elon Musk killing Twitter? How bankruptcy might not be the end</strong> <small>2023-02-02 18:59:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate between an investor and a journalist looks into what is happening at the social media company</p>
<p>Last October, Elon Musk completed his move to acquire Twitter (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover) after a short legal brawl, but the joy of the move was short-lived. Having fired the top brass the same day, Musk moved on to firing more than half of Twitter’s staff, and bad news kept poring out of the San Francisco headquarters quite regularly.</p>
<p>As we enter the New Year, the situation hasn’t changed much, and Twitter continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons, like not paying rent for its office spaces and employees being forced out of buildings by landlords, The New York Times reported (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur). The question that crosses one’s mind is if Musk is out to kill Twitter once and for all.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.Intelligence Squared (http://opentodebate.org), a platform known for organizing debates, took up this question and set up a debate between Kara Swisher, the editor-at-large at New York Magazine, and Anthony Scaramucci, managing partner at Skybridge capital and former communications director at the White House.</p>
<p>Neither Swisher nor Scaramucci have a personal or professional relationship with Musk, even though they have met and interacted with the now Twitter CEO on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at various aspects of the effects Elon Musk's takeover has had on Twitter.</p>
<p>Active Users
Musk’s actions have allegedly led to a drop in usage among active users, who usually contribute a lot of content to the platform, and is forcing users to give competitors, like Mastodon, a try, Swisher said while stating that Musk's leadership was leading to Twitter's downfall.</p>
<p>Comparing it to a proverbial town square, Scaramucci argued that Twitter, since Musk’s takeover had more active users and was at the center of many important events, whether it was the FIFA World Cup or the FTX debacle.</p>
<p>Journalists could cover nuances of a story thanks to Twitter while people get updates about people they follow from the platform. Twitter Spaces turned out to be an effective medium and preferable over ClubHouse. When Musk himself joined Twitter Space, more than 100,000 people were in attendance listening and asking questions, Scaramucci said while defending that Musk wasn't killing Twitter.</p>
<p>Return of banned accounts
Swisher pointed out Musk-led Twitter has allowed 60,000 accounts previously suspended back on the platform to “improve the conversation”. Worse still, the decision to allow these users back seems to have been made single-handedly by Musk, instead of a council that was supposed to be set up.</p>
<p>Scaramucci argued that by bringing people back, Musk was giving them a platform to voice their opinions rather than shut them off. This way, he was bringing them back into the social contract. He added that when individuals speak, think and speak freely, it creates economic innovation.</p>
<p>Loss of revenue
Swisher strongly argued that Musk was indeed killing Twitter after his arrival blew off $5 billion in advertising revenues for the social media company, which was significant for income in the pre-Musk days. His plans of launching the paid subscription model of revenue generation hurt corporate clients more as users faked companies after paying $8 a month and got verified checks to their fake usernames.</p>
<p>Scaramucci added that large corporations were risk averse and did not want to advertise on Twitter due to what Musk was doing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s valuation drops
Swisher also pointed out a report that the Bank of America and Morgan Stanley who lent Musk money to finance his Twitter deal have now halved the Twitter debt on their books, which means the company’s equity has been wiped out in just two months after Musk has arrived at the helm of the affairs.</p>
<p>Scaramucci ceded that Twitter’s valuations were down but argued that the company was far from dead and could see a revival in the coming months and years. Instead with a more active user base, the company was more vital than ever.</p>
<p>Could Twitter go bankrupt?
Swisher pointed out that Musk first spoke about Twitter's potential bankruptcy (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/twitter-possible-bankruptcy-top-executives-leave). While it is likely that Musk, the world’s richest person, will not let it happen, he had many wealthy friends who could put money into the company if it came to that.</p>
<p>However, she warned that if the loan ended up on Wall Street, it could be bought by someone else, who would want Musk out before he could fix what he had broken at Twitter. She argued that although Twitter got a lot of attention from politicians and the media, it wasn’t a great business when compared to other social media outlets, and with Musk at the helm had turned into a lousy business.</p>
<p>Comparison with Tesla, SpaceX
Scaramucci’s faith in Elon Musk to revive Twitter comes from his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, staring at bankruptcy in 2008. Back then, it was Musk’s leadership that steered them away to levels that made him one of the richest people in the world (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-just-got-36-billion-richer-in-a-single-day).</p>
<p>He said that Musk may have started on the wrong foot with Twitter trying to give away verified badges for a fee but, having realized his mistake, reversed his decision. In the long run, Scaramucci expects Musk to get things right at Twitter.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, argued that too much faith was being put into Musk’s ability because of his history. Musk was good at making cars and rockets, but that does not mean he will be good at media too.</p>
<p>Twitter being a media company puts him in a very different situation, and his ideas to ‘unlock its potential’ are retreads of what many orders have suggested in the past. In fact, Musk has been unable to execute them properly and has made the site more erratic as of now.</p>
<p>Swisher also referred to Steve Jobs as a true visionary who stayed in his lane and did great things. Musk, on the other hand, does not seem to have a clue about what he is up to.</p>
<p>Musk’s vision for Twitter
Scaramucci, an investor, had access to a Powerpoint presentation for Musk’s vision for Twitter, which said that he wants to broaden the social media base and make it more inclusive. Going forward, Musk wants Twitter to become a ‘super app’ much like WeChat, which is used in China by users for social media, making payments, and personal communication.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, said that ‘super apps’ have not worked in the U.S. before, and even the likes of Apple and Amazon have tried to do it and failed so far. It might be working in China, but the U.S. was a different market, and people would trust Amazon or Apple with their payments but not Twitter.</p>
<p>Moreover, people used different apps for different purposes, like Snapchat for communication and TikTok for entertainment. Like Facebook usage has dropped, Twitter under Musk is heading the same way.</p>
<p>Twitter: Unassailable or Obsolete?
Due to its ability to connect people to events happening globally, Scaramucci said, Twitter had found a niche for itself in the past 15 years of its existence and become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Even if Musk failed in his mission to turn the company around, he would leave, and someone else could steady the ship.</p>
<p>With Musk planning to ring in many changes in how Twitter looks and behaves, users could be worried if the sudden changes would keep the platform usable. Swisher thinks that if the user experience dips and people find it hard to use Twitter, then it is likely that competitors will make something easier to use, shifting the user base away.</p>
<p>Swisher was pessimistic that the company could survive the Elon storm and compared his management style to building a rocket while it was in flight. Worse still, his decisions were taking the rocket on a downward trajectory, and Musk was single-handedly making the decisions. Swisher would not be surprised if Twitter soon became part of the graveyard of internet companies such as AOL, AIM, Yahoo, and MySpace, which were great at one time but have become obsolete over the years.</p>
<p>Impact on Musk
The time Musk spends at Twitter also affects his other ventures, such as Tesla, Swisher argued. The EV-making company had seen a steep decline in its valuation (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/musk-lose-200-billion), with Twitter serving as a larger distraction for Musk, the CEO, than when he was just a prolific user of the platform.</p>
<p>The competition in the EV market has grown, and Tesla is ceding its market share, which took years to build, very rapidly. The mass firing of staff at Twitter is also resulting in class action lawsuits and which are likely to be the biggest ones in Musk’s life.</p>
<p>Scaramucci quoting Warren Buffett that a high-quality business can endure a bad management team or terrible decisions to set the tone of his defense is a strong indicator of what’s happening at Twitter.</p>

<div><strong>Is TikTok a security threat? CT legislators ask for hard data on spying as ban considered</strong> <small>2023-03-16 18:28:03</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Government Administration and Elections Committee heard testimony (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXUHL0z8mpA) on a bill (https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/TOB/S/PDF/2023SB-01191-R00-SB.PDF) that would ban TikTok (https://www.ctinsider.com/politics/article/ct-legislature-considers-banning-tiktok-wechat-17771929.php) from being used by government employees or public officials on state-owned devices. The sole exception would be for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a member of Generation Z to know what TikTok is, said Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, during a Friday meeting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has repeatedly pointed out the danger that this application poses to government entities.</p>
<p>Rep. Gale Mastrofranceso, R-Southington, said, I gotta be honest with you, I'm on the fence on it.Do you have any data besides the news outlets? Do we have hard facts?</p>
<p>The proposed bill before the General Assembly would also charge the chief information officer, chief information security officer, and the chief court administrator to jointly develop security standards for computer programs and state-issued devices to counter cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>During the testimony, board members asked Duff and Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, if there was any concrete evidence about the espionage threat of TikTok.</p>
<p>I’m a freedom guy, as you know, said Sen. Rob Samson, R-Southington. Do you have any concrete evidence?”</p>
<p>Fazio replied The best example is that employees of ByteDance used TikTok geolocation data specifically to track journalists whom they suspected of speaking to employees of TikTok in the U.S. The ability of these applications to retain and collect data is immense.</p>
<p>In replies to requests for more data on the privacy threats of TikTok, Duff, and Fazio pointed to news reports about TikTok tracking journalists and the testimony of FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Jeff Brown, the current chief information security officer, and Mark Raymond, the chief information officer, asked the various intelligence and security agencies, including the FBI, for guidance on TikTok</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by CT Insider via a Freedom of Information request, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had no additional evidence to provide that TikTok was a security threat.</p>
<p>I asked one of my analysts to reach out to our HQ … She couldn’t find evidence that we had any additional information to share,” wrote FBI supervisory agent Connor Phoenix in an email to Connecticut officials. Sorry, we don’t have more to offer.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between what the cybersecurity agents could provide and what the FBI director is saying in public is likely political, says Milton Mueller, director of the Internet Governance Project of Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Chris Wray is not an expert on cybersecurity. The FBI director is a political appointee and he is touting a political line, Mueller said in an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate earlier this month. (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/) This is a foreign policy case. There are people who believe in decoupling from China, and they will interpret any connection to a Chinese company as a threat. There’s really no evidence that this is harming the United States.</p></div>

Under his guidance, a slew of firings, a resurgence of unsavory Tweeters, and a bevy of on-again, off-again bans, have all raised questions about the platform’s long-term viability. Some investors have labeled Musk an albatross around Twitter’s neck, calling for him to stay focused on Tesla and SpaceX. Others say Musk is actually freeing the bird from anti-conservative censorship, which will engender more open discourse. His moves, they say, are all a part of a broader business acumen that has proven successful in the past. In that context, we ask the timely question of whether Elon Musk is killing Twitter.</span><span class="eop"> </span>

<div><strong>Is Elon Musk killing Twitter? How bankruptcy might not be the end</strong> <small>2023-02-02 18:59:19</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>A debate between an investor and a journalist looks into what is happening at the social media company</p>
<p>Last October, Elon Musk completed his move to acquire Twitter (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover) after a short legal brawl, but the joy of the move was short-lived. Having fired the top brass the same day, Musk moved on to firing more than half of Twitter’s staff, and bad news kept poring out of the San Francisco headquarters quite regularly.</p>
<p>As we enter the New Year, the situation hasn’t changed much, and Twitter continues to be in the news for all the wrong reasons, like not paying rent for its office spaces and employees being forced out of buildings by landlords, The New York Times reported (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/technology/elon-musk-twitter-shakeup.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur). The question that crosses one’s mind is if Musk is out to kill Twitter once and for all.</p>
<p>Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S.Intelligence Squared (http://opentodebate.org), a platform known for organizing debates, took up this question and set up a debate between Kara Swisher, the editor-at-large at New York Magazine, and Anthony Scaramucci, managing partner at Skybridge capital and former communications director at the White House.</p>
<p>Neither Swisher nor Scaramucci have a personal or professional relationship with Musk, even though they have met and interacted with the now Twitter CEO on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at various aspects of the effects Elon Musk's takeover has had on Twitter.</p>
<p>Active Users
Musk’s actions have allegedly led to a drop in usage among active users, who usually contribute a lot of content to the platform, and is forcing users to give competitors, like Mastodon, a try, Swisher said while stating that Musk's leadership was leading to Twitter's downfall.</p>
<p>Comparing it to a proverbial town square, Scaramucci argued that Twitter, since Musk’s takeover had more active users and was at the center of many important events, whether it was the FIFA World Cup or the FTX debacle.</p>
<p>Journalists could cover nuances of a story thanks to Twitter while people get updates about people they follow from the platform. Twitter Spaces turned out to be an effective medium and preferable over ClubHouse. When Musk himself joined Twitter Space, more than 100,000 people were in attendance listening and asking questions, Scaramucci said while defending that Musk wasn't killing Twitter.</p>
<p>Return of banned accounts
Swisher pointed out Musk-led Twitter has allowed 60,000 accounts previously suspended back on the platform to “improve the conversation”. Worse still, the decision to allow these users back seems to have been made single-handedly by Musk, instead of a council that was supposed to be set up.</p>
<p>Scaramucci argued that by bringing people back, Musk was giving them a platform to voice their opinions rather than shut them off. This way, he was bringing them back into the social contract. He added that when individuals speak, think and speak freely, it creates economic innovation.</p>
<p>Loss of revenue
Swisher strongly argued that Musk was indeed killing Twitter after his arrival blew off $5 billion in advertising revenues for the social media company, which was significant for income in the pre-Musk days. His plans of launching the paid subscription model of revenue generation hurt corporate clients more as users faked companies after paying $8 a month and got verified checks to their fake usernames.</p>
<p>Scaramucci added that large corporations were risk averse and did not want to advertise on Twitter due to what Musk was doing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s valuation drops
Swisher also pointed out a report that the Bank of America and Morgan Stanley who lent Musk money to finance his Twitter deal have now halved the Twitter debt on their books, which means the company’s equity has been wiped out in just two months after Musk has arrived at the helm of the affairs.</p>
<p>Scaramucci ceded that Twitter’s valuations were down but argued that the company was far from dead and could see a revival in the coming months and years. Instead with a more active user base, the company was more vital than ever.</p>
<p>Could Twitter go bankrupt?
Swisher pointed out that Musk first spoke about Twitter's potential bankruptcy (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/twitter-possible-bankruptcy-top-executives-leave). While it is likely that Musk, the world’s richest person, will not let it happen, he had many wealthy friends who could put money into the company if it came to that.</p>
<p>However, she warned that if the loan ended up on Wall Street, it could be bought by someone else, who would want Musk out before he could fix what he had broken at Twitter. She argued that although Twitter got a lot of attention from politicians and the media, it wasn’t a great business when compared to other social media outlets, and with Musk at the helm had turned into a lousy business.</p>
<p>Comparison with Tesla, SpaceX
Scaramucci’s faith in Elon Musk to revive Twitter comes from his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, staring at bankruptcy in 2008. Back then, it was Musk’s leadership that steered them away to levels that made him one of the richest people in the world (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/elon-musk-just-got-36-billion-richer-in-a-single-day).</p>
<p>He said that Musk may have started on the wrong foot with Twitter trying to give away verified badges for a fee but, having realized his mistake, reversed his decision. In the long run, Scaramucci expects Musk to get things right at Twitter.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, argued that too much faith was being put into Musk’s ability because of his history. Musk was good at making cars and rockets, but that does not mean he will be good at media too.</p>
<p>Twitter being a media company puts him in a very different situation, and his ideas to ‘unlock its potential’ are retreads of what many orders have suggested in the past. In fact, Musk has been unable to execute them properly and has made the site more erratic as of now.</p>
<p>Swisher also referred to Steve Jobs as a true visionary who stayed in his lane and did great things. Musk, on the other hand, does not seem to have a clue about what he is up to.</p>
<p>Musk’s vision for Twitter
Scaramucci, an investor, had access to a Powerpoint presentation for Musk’s vision for Twitter, which said that he wants to broaden the social media base and make it more inclusive. Going forward, Musk wants Twitter to become a ‘super app’ much like WeChat, which is used in China by users for social media, making payments, and personal communication.</p>
<p>Swisher, however, said that ‘super apps’ have not worked in the U.S. before, and even the likes of Apple and Amazon have tried to do it and failed so far. It might be working in China, but the U.S. was a different market, and people would trust Amazon or Apple with their payments but not Twitter.</p>
<p>Moreover, people used different apps for different purposes, like Snapchat for communication and TikTok for entertainment. Like Facebook usage has dropped, Twitter under Musk is heading the same way.</p>
<p>Twitter: Unassailable or Obsolete?
Due to its ability to connect people to events happening globally, Scaramucci said, Twitter had found a niche for itself in the past 15 years of its existence and become an indispensable part of our daily lives. Even if Musk failed in his mission to turn the company around, he would leave, and someone else could steady the ship.</p>
<p>With Musk planning to ring in many changes in how Twitter looks and behaves, users could be worried if the sudden changes would keep the platform usable. Swisher thinks that if the user experience dips and people find it hard to use Twitter, then it is likely that competitors will make something easier to use, shifting the user base away.</p>
<p>Swisher was pessimistic that the company could survive the Elon storm and compared his management style to building a rocket while it was in flight. Worse still, his decisions were taking the rocket on a downward trajectory, and Musk was single-handedly making the decisions. Swisher would not be surprised if Twitter soon became part of the graveyard of internet companies such as AOL, AIM, Yahoo, and MySpace, which were great at one time but have become obsolete over the years.</p>
<p>Impact on Musk
The time Musk spends at Twitter also affects his other ventures, such as Tesla, Swisher argued. The EV-making company had seen a steep decline in its valuation (https://interestingengineering.com/culture/musk-lose-200-billion), with Twitter serving as a larger distraction for Musk, the CEO, than when he was just a prolific user of the platform.</p>
<p>The competition in the EV market has grown, and Tesla is ceding its market share, which took years to build, very rapidly. The mass firing of staff at Twitter is also resulting in class action lawsuits and which are likely to be the biggest ones in Musk’s life.</p>
<p>Scaramucci quoting Warren Buffett that a high-quality business can endure a bad management team or terrible decisions to set the tone of his defense is a strong indicator of what’s happening at Twitter.</p>

<div><strong>Is TikTok a security threat? CT legislators ask for hard data on spying as ban considered</strong> <small>2023-03-16 18:28:03</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>The Government Administration and Elections Committee heard testimony (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXUHL0z8mpA) on a bill (https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/TOB/S/PDF/2023SB-01191-R00-SB.PDF) that would ban TikTok (https://www.ctinsider.com/politics/article/ct-legislature-considers-banning-tiktok-wechat-17771929.php) from being used by government employees or public officials on state-owned devices. The sole exception would be for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a member of Generation Z to know what TikTok is, said Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, during a Friday meeting. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has repeatedly pointed out the danger that this application poses to government entities.</p>
<p>Rep. Gale Mastrofranceso, R-Southington, said, I gotta be honest with you, I'm on the fence on it.Do you have any data besides the news outlets? Do we have hard facts?</p>
<p>The proposed bill before the General Assembly would also charge the chief information officer, chief information security officer, and the chief court administrator to jointly develop security standards for computer programs and state-issued devices to counter cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>During the testimony, board members asked Duff and Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, if there was any concrete evidence about the espionage threat of TikTok.</p>
<p>I’m a freedom guy, as you know, said Sen. Rob Samson, R-Southington. Do you have any concrete evidence?”</p>
<p>Fazio replied The best example is that employees of ByteDance used TikTok geolocation data specifically to track journalists whom they suspected of speaking to employees of TikTok in the U.S. The ability of these applications to retain and collect data is immense.</p>
<p>In replies to requests for more data on the privacy threats of TikTok, Duff, and Fazio pointed to news reports about TikTok tracking journalists and the testimony of FBI Director Chris Wray.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Jeff Brown, the current chief information security officer, and Mark Raymond, the chief information officer, asked the various intelligence and security agencies, including the FBI, for guidance on TikTok</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by CT Insider via a Freedom of Information request, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had no additional evidence to provide that TikTok was a security threat.</p>
<p>I asked one of my analysts to reach out to our HQ … She couldn’t find evidence that we had any additional information to share,” wrote FBI supervisory agent Connor Phoenix in an email to Connecticut officials. Sorry, we don’t have more to offer.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between what the cybersecurity agents could provide and what the FBI director is saying in public is likely political, says Milton Mueller, director of the Internet Governance Project of Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Chris Wray is not an expert on cybersecurity. The FBI director is a political appointee and he is touting a political line, Mueller said in an Open to Debate formerly known as Intelligence Squared U.S. debate earlier this month. (https://opentodebate.org/debate/should-the-u-s-ban-tiktok/#/) This is a foreign policy case. There are people who believe in decoupling from China, and they will interpret any connection to a Chinese company as a threat. There’s really no evidence that this is harming the United States.</p></div>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Politics</p>
<p>By now it is clear, the Red Wave election-denying candidates had hoped to ride left most still waiting on the beach. Those who questioned the outcome of the 2020 election lost key midterm races, which seemed to calm the nerves of many of those fearful as to where the Republic itself was headed. But as the parties begin to prepare for their respective presidential runs, a bigger question looms; one that has taken its cues from President Biden himself. Shortly after the January 6th attacks on the capitol — which were prompted by unfounded messaging about the election’s illegitimacy — Biden sought to convey the severity of what had just happened. “The insurrection was an existential crisis — a test of whether our democracy could survive,” he said. Now, on the heels of the midterms, many not only openly wonder whether that democracy crisis is over, but also question if the words Biden chose were overblown in the first place. It is in that context, and as the 2024 elections come into focus, that we debate this question: Was January 6 an existential threat to American democracy?
On December 15th, <strong>Andrew Keen</strong>, Author, and Host of the “How to Fix Democracy” podcast, squares off against Election Strategist, Managing Partner at CAE Strategies, and Vice President of the Fair Elections Center, <strong>Rebekah Caruthers</strong>, as part of the “No Laughing Matter” series at the Comedy Cellar at the Village Underground in New York. <strong>The podcast release date will be January 6, 2023.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Politics</p>
<p>By now it is clear, the Red Wave election-denying candidates had hoped to ride left most still waiting on the beach. Those who questioned the outcome of the 2020 election lost key midterm races, which seemed to calm the nerves of many of those fearful as to where the Republic itself was headed. But as the parties begin to prepare for their respective presidential runs, a bigger question looms; one that has taken its cues from President Biden himself. Shortly after the January 6th attacks on the capitol — which were prompted by unfounded messaging about the election’s illegitimacy — Biden sought to convey the severity of what had just happened. “The insurrection was an existential crisis — a test of whether our democracy could survive,” he said. Now, on the heels of the midterms, many not only openly wonder whether that democracy crisis is over, but also question if the words Biden chose were overblown in the first place. It is in that context, and as the 2024 elections come into focus, that we debate this question: Was January 6 an existential threat to American democracy?
On December 15th, <strong>Andrew Keen</strong>, Author, and Host of the “How to Fix Democracy” podcast, squares off against Election Strategist, Managing Partner at CAE Strategies, and Vice President of the Fair Elections Center, <strong>Rebekah Caruthers</strong>, as part of the “No Laughing Matter” series at the Comedy Cellar at the Village Underground in New York. <strong>The podcast release date will be January 6, 2023.</strong></p>

<p>For a period of time, going global just seemed to make sense. But with China’s rise, Covid-19, and the war in Ukraine, words like “localnomics,” “friends-shoring,” and “decoupling” have helped codify a growing movement that calls for less interdependence between economies. Those in favor of a more “deglobalized” system of trade argue that it is not only more environmentally friendly and responsive to regional needs, but also less of a driver of income inequality. Indeed, globalization’s three-decade trend of trade growing at twice the speed of the world economy has not lifted all boats, they argue. For many, including middle income populations in the industrialized west, it has backfired. Deglobalization is a welcome a shift. Others disagree. Globalization’s virtues are unmistakable, they say, resulting in less poverty and higher incomes across the world. People once cut off from markets benefit from new connections in commerce, culture, and communications. For them, it has not backfired. In fact, in the face of political challenges and volatile markets, more regionally-focused trade constitutes a dangerous circling of the wagons. In this context, we ask the question: Has Globalization Backfired?
This debate was presented and produced in partnership with <a href="https://www.ypo.org/ypoedge/">YPO EDGE</a> and took place in front of a live audience, at the YPO EDGE convention.</p>
