<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics, Education, Finance, Science, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In a world being reshaped by vital questions about Al, sustainability, and an uncertain global economy, now is the time for decisive action.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">As a Knowledge Partner with the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute, this episode will showcase the power of debate and its positive impact on humanity.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With the debut of a new, engaging format, featuring three fast-paced rounds, six debaters take on questions of Money, Truth, and Power in a debate titled "Clash of the Titans." The debate examines three provocative questions with three sets of influential debaters: whether the future of currency is fiat or crypto, whether Al will change the nature of truth, and whether it's time to give even more power to tech companies.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">You will also hear an excerpt of our "UNRESOLVED: What's Europe's Economic Outlook?" in which you will hear three influential titans of industry debate whether investors should make a bet on Europe. In a full-standing debate on the popular topic of Al, you'll hear a spirited discussion about whether Al art can generate the emotional impact of traditional art and whether Western influence will dominate its evolution.</span>
<b><span data-contrast="auto">These debates took place at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during FII8. Full versions of these debates can be found on Open to Debate and FII Institute’s YouTube channels.</span></b>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics, Education, Finance, Science, Tech, U.S., World</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In a world being reshaped by vital questions about Al, sustainability, and an uncertain global economy, now is the time for decisive action.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">As a Knowledge Partner with the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute, this episode will showcase the power of debate and its positive impact on humanity.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">With the debut of a new, engaging format, featuring three fast-paced rounds, six debaters take on questions of Money, Truth, and Power in a debate titled "Clash of the Titans." The debate examines three provocative questions with three sets of influential debaters: whether the future of currency is fiat or crypto, whether Al will change the nature of truth, and whether it's time to give even more power to tech companies.</span>
<span data-contrast="auto">You will also hear an excerpt of our "UNRESOLVED: What's Europe's Economic Outlook?" in which you will hear three influential titans of industry debate whether investors should make a bet on Europe. In a full-standing debate on the popular topic of Al, you'll hear a spirited discussion about whether Al art can generate the emotional impact of traditional art and whether Western influence will dominate its evolution.</span>
<b><span data-contrast="auto">These debates took place at the King Abdulaziz International Conference Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during FII8. Full versions of these debates can be found on Open to Debate and FII Institute’s YouTube channels.</span></b>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Is that new $12 dress you saw trending on TikTok worth it? Brands like Shein, H&M, Zara, and Primark have made it easy to stay on-trend, thanks to the fast fashion industry. These inexpensive, truly-of-the-moment clothes let shoppers update their wardrobes with a click, but at what cost? Critics who say it’s time to stop supporting it argue that fast fashion is among the most polluting industries, rife with labor violations, and responsible for massive clothing waste. The environmental damage and unfair working conditions in countries with weak regulations have fueled a growing backlash. On the other hand, those who argue it’s still fine to shop say it makes all kinds of fashion available to everyone who might otherwise be priced out, provides livelihoods for millions of workers, and boosts local economies. Ultimately, it’s up to shoppers to decide where to place their money.</span>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, U.S., World</p>
<p>Israel and Iran have been in a proxy conflict for decades, but it escalated to a new level this year during the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Now with rising tensions and new rocket strikes by Iran and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, which is allied with Hamas, world leaders are watching closely and wondering if Israel should take military action against Iran. Those who believe Israel should attack Iran argue that the country is an existential threat to Israel’s existence, Iran has been growing as an influence in the Middle East, and their support of organizations such as Hamas and the Houthis causes increased destabilization in the Middle East. Those who believe Israel shouldn’t attack Iran say doing so would further expand into a regional conflict, diminish the possibilities of future peace negotiations, and strain Israel’s relationship with key allies.
With this context, we debate the question: Should Israel Strike Iran?</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Politics</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In recent years, and especially during critical election seasons, identity politics have become a big part of American political discourse, with both Democrats and Republicans leveraging issues of race, gender, and class to engage voters and adopt identity-driven platforms to appeal to specific voting blocs. Vice President Kamala Harris’s entry as a female, mixed-race candidate has brought up questions about whether focusing on identity is distracting us from the issues at hand. Those who don’t think so argue that voters from diverse backgrounds want to see their unique concerns addressed, and identity politics offers a pathway for inclusion, representation, and empowerment for groups that have been historically sidelined. Those who think it is holding us back argue it distracts from broader policy discussions, prevents constructive dialogue on solutions that benefit everyone, and risks alienating large segments of the electorate who may feel excluded from the conversation.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">In recent years, and especially during critical election seasons, identity politics have become a big part of American political discourse, with both Democrats and Republicans leveraging issues of race, gender, and class to engage voters and adopt identity-driven platforms to appeal to specific voting blocs. Vice President Kamala Harris’s entry as a female, mixed-race candidate has brought up questions about whether focusing on identity is distracting us from the issues at hand. Those who don’t think so argue that voters from diverse backgrounds want to see their unique concerns addressed, and identity politics offers a pathway for inclusion, representation, and empowerment for groups that have been historically sidelined. Those who think it is holding us back argue it distracts from broader policy discussions, prevents constructive dialogue on solutions that benefit everyone, and risks alienating large segments of the electorate who may feel excluded from the conversation.</span>

<span data-contrast="none">In the year since the beginning of the conflict between Israel and Hamas, the question of proportionality in response to October 7th has taken center stage. Both sides have reported high death tolls, the risk of famine and disease is growing, over a hundred hostages of various nationalities remain in Gaza, and ceasefire proposals are ongoing with no end in sight. Those who support Israel’s response argue that Israel has the right to defend itself like any country under attack; it needs to do all it can to bring the hostages home and prevent Hamas from posing any future threat. However, critics of Israel’s response contend that it has led to a humanitarian crisis, failed to protect Palestinian civilians, and jeopardized long-term peace in the Middle East.</span>

<div><strong>Open to Debate Chairman Robert Rosenkranz Named as an ‘Innovator’ in the TIME100 Philanthropy List for 2025</strong> <small>2025-05-21 16:22:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Private equity investor Robert Rosenkranz calls himself a “selfish philanthropist.” He even devoted a whole chapter of his new book, The Stoic Capitalist, to this concept. “The best form of philanthropy, to me, is when you use your talents, skills, and strategic insights to bring into being something that you feel society needs and could benefit from,” he says.</p>
<p>That ambition led Rosenkranz, chairman of Delphi Capital Management, via his Rosenkranz Foundation to found his most well-known philanthropic endeavour: Open to Debate. Appetite for the program’s nonpartisan high-profile debates surged last year, with more than six million people watching former Israeli spokesperson Eylon Levy and journalist Mehdi Hasan answer the question: “Were Israel’s Actions in the Gaza War Justified?” The platform also took on the presidential debates, working with Princeton University on a series of recommendations (read more than three million times so far) to strengthen the format.</p>
<p>Other recent initiatives include founding Canyon, a cultural institution planned for New York City’s Lower East Side that will showcase immersive works of visual art, music, and technology. Partnering with Saudi Arabia’s Hevolution Foundation, Rosenkranz also provided $5 million of a total $10 million in grants for research on aging and longevity, which helped fund a study of worms that resulted in a significant extension of the organism’s lifespan. “If we can push off the diseases of old age, the reduction in physical strength or mental acuity that occurs, by 10 or 15 years, that seems to me the greatest gift to human flourishing that science can bestow,” Rosenkranz says.</p></div>]]></description>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Over the past decade, social justice movements have helped reshape K-12 curricula to include discussions on systemic racism, privilege, gender diversity, and sex education — a set of changes that some refer to as "woke." While some school districts have adopted these practices, some parents, teachers, and community leaders are concerned about whether these topics should be taught in school. Those </span><span data-contrast="none">who think this subject matter helps stud</span><span data-contrast="none">ents argue that incorporating them in classrooms makes students socially aware and responsible citizens. They also say that this emerging effort to educate America’s youth about historical injustices and topics surrounding race and gender helps create a more inclusive society. Those who believe these topics hurt students argue that teaching these topics indoctrinates students into learning about certain ideologies their parents may not want them learning about and they worry it can polarize and lead to discomfort among non-minority students, lowering their self-esteem and promoting a “victimhood mentality”. </span><span data-contrast="none">Some parents are also concerned that schools are no longer focusing enough on core traditional courses, such as math, science, reading, and social studies. </span>

Those who agree with the ICC argue that it’s a necessary step in enforcing international law, ensuring accountability, and helping provide justice to victims.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Donald Trump is the first former president to be convicted of a crime. He was found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree under New York law. Trump has the right to appeal and announced the day after the conviction that he would. Now there is also a Supreme Court ruling that says presidential immunity is permitted for official acts committed in office. Legal scholars are questioning whether his conviction could be overturned and what could come next. Those defending the New York court conviction argue that no individual, regardless of their office, is above the law, and keeping Trump accountable is crucial for upholding the rule of law. Its overturning would set a dangerous precedent undermining the judicial system's integrity. Those arguing for the defendant argue the laws under which Trump was convicted were misinterpreted or misapplied, possibly extending beyond their intended scope and his actions, since they were during his tenure, and some may have been within remit of his official duties.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As the war between Israel and Hamas is ongoing, the nonpartisan debate series Open to Debate in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations is taking a closer look at one proposed solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The two-state solution proposes a sovereign State of Palestine alongside the State of Israel and aims to address the territorial disputes, security concerns, and national aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. However, many have questioned whether</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-contrast="none">this plan is still possible</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> especially during the Israel-Gaza war happening now. Those who believe it’s still possible argue that it’s the most logical path toward achieving sustainable peace and fulfilling the national self-determination rights of both Israelis and Palestinians while respecting international laws and U.N. resolutions. Those who believe it is no longer possible argue that the ongoing violence, West Bank settlement expansions, lack of trust, and failure of previous negotiation attempts such as the Oslo Accords make having both states impractical.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">As the war between Israel and Hamas is ongoing, the nonpartisan debate series Open to Debate in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations is taking a closer look at one proposed solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The two-state solution proposes a sovereign State of Palestine alongside the State of Israel and aims to address the territorial disputes, security concerns, and national aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. However, many have questioned whether</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-contrast="none">this plan is still possible</span><span data-contrast="none">,</span><span data-contrast="none"> especially during the Israel-Gaza war happening now. Those who believe it’s still possible argue that it’s the most logical path toward achieving sustainable peace and fulfilling the national self-determination rights of both Israelis and Palestinians while respecting international laws and U.N. resolutions. Those who believe it is no longer possible argue that the ongoing violence, West Bank settlement expansions, lack of trust, and failure of previous negotiation attempts such as the Oslo Accords make having both states impractical.</span>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the current election cycle, President Biden has dismissed concerns about seeking re-election. He says that he is fit for the job and in it to win it. But after the first 2024 Presidential Debate, many public officials, donors, and die-hard Democratic voters have expressed deep concern about Biden’s performance.

<div><strong>Jake Tapper Says The Quiet Part Out Loud About Media’s Incestuous Ties To Democrat Party</strong> <small>2025-06-05 14:21:23</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CNN anchor Jake Tapper said during a Thursday podcast that the press has advanced the interests of the Democratic Party for years.</p>
<p>“The Remnant (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuFVNj1koyI)” host Jonah Goldberg said it seemed “indisputable” to him that the media would have investigated former President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline significantly more had he been a Republican or had President Donald Trump been a more establishment Republican. Tapper acknowledged the premise was valid. (RELATED: ‘They Abused Us’: Fox WH Correspondent Details Pressure Biden White House Put On Reporters Over President’s Condition) (https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/22/fox-wh-correspondent-pressure-biden-white-house-reporters-presidents-condition/)</p>
<p>“If Donald Trump was a Bush-type, Romney-type Republican, the stakes would have been perceived as less,” Goldberg said. “But like, the one group of people who believe Biden’s ‘existential threat to democracy’ stuff about Trump was a big chunk of the D.C. press corps.”</p>
<p>“I don’t disagree with your general premise. And I think it’s unfortunate that a lot of the press criticism and journalism — and most known journalism professors out there — have been saying since the Bush years that it is the responsibility of journalists to basically take up the Democratic cause — capital D, not small-d — the Democratic Party cause,” Tapper responded. “And I think that’s unfortunate. I don’t doubt that there were a lot of people who viewed the world that way.”</p>
<p>However, the CNN anchor also argued that there are more complex issues at play than merely partisanship.</p>
<p>“I think it’s probably more complicated than partisanship, just because we contain multitudes — we’re people too, journalists — and I think there’s probably a lot of groupthink,” he said. “I think there’s probably a lot of intimidation.”</p>
<p>“I think there’s lots of reasons for it. I don’t disagree with your general premise — that is, if this had been, you know, Joe Biden versus Mitt Romney, maybe the press corps would have been tougher,” he added. “But … I also think the press corps was pretty unfair to Mitt Romney in 2012. So I don’t know that premise to be correct … it’s all very complicated. Which is not to let the press off the hook — or myself off the hook — but it’s more complicated than just ‘the press is partisan and therefore they didn’t report on this.'”</p>
<p>Tapper also asserted (https://x.com/JasonJournoDC/status/1928786299843948930) on “Open To Debate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXhaScstmYY)” on Friday that he didn’t vote for Biden or Trump and “can’t stand either party” — so it wasn’t partisan “bias” that softened his coverage of Biden’s decline. However, he then admitted that he bought into Democrats’ lies.</p>
<p>“What was shaping my reporting was, I think, the fact that, like, there were just a lot of people lying to us. And I should have just been more skeptical about the fact that they were lying to us,” he said. “But there were just so many people on the inside, and so many Democratic legislators, and so many members of the cabinet and everything, that were just completely gaslighting the country.”</p>
<p>Tapper has received backlash (https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/14/mark-halperin-sledgehammer-two-premises-jake-tappers-book-bidens-decline/) for writing “Original Sin” — a new book about Biden’s decline and its cover-up — based on his own failure to probe Biden’s cognitive decline while he was president. Tapper (https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/20/charlamagne-cnn-jake-tapper-complicit-biden-cover-up/) himself has acknowledged that he did not cover Biden’s decline sufficiently and that he reflected on his reporting with “humility” during promotional interviews for the book.</p></div>
<div><strong>Tapper: "I Didn't Vote For Biden Or Trump... So That Wasn't A Bias Of Mine"</strong> <small>2025-06-05 14:28:49</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>CNN's Jake Tapper denies any political bias in his reporting, telling "Open To Debate" that he did not vote for either Biden or Trump and "can't stand either party."</p>
<p>"That's not to say that I'm denying that there's a liberal bias in the media—I'm not denying that, 100%. But on health and sensitivity issues, I just don't think so," he said.</p>
<p>"I find it odd that Alex and I have had more to say about our roles as reporters in this. Not that we shouldn’t be talking about it," he said. "I’m happy to own anything I’ve ever done or not done—but this was the Democratic Party that did this."</p>

<p>JAKE TAPPER: I didn't vote for Biden or Trump. I can't stand either party, to be quite honest. So that wasn't a bias of mine in terms of shaping my reporting.</p>
<p>But what was shaping my reporting was, I think, the fact that there were just a lot of people lying to us. I should have just been more skeptical about the fact that they were lying to us. But there were just so many people on the inside—so many Democratic legislators and so many members of the cabinet and everything—who were just completely gaslighting the country.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>These issues of health are so sensitive to talk about and to report. And as you say—yes, we saw weird moments of Joe Biden. We also see weird moments—and they're different, they're not the same issue, they're not acuity issues—but we see weird moments of Donald Trump calling Nancy Pelosi "Nikki Haley" and the like.</p>
<p>But it's impossible to say, as you noted, "This is what's going on behind closed doors," if nobody behind those closed doors is talking.</p>
<p>So I really just don't think that—I mean, there are a million questions I'd love to ask about what's going on behind the scenes in the Trump White House that we can't get, because they're not talking. I get that. That's their job—it’s not their job to leak to us anymore. And this is a much less leaky Trump White House than the first one.</p>
<p>So I guess I just don't think so. That's not to say that I'm denying that there's a liberal bias in the media—I'm not denying that, 100%. But on health and sensitivity issues, I just don't think so.</p>
<p>In 2019, Donald Trump went to Walter Reed, and we still don't know what he went to Walter Reed for. It still hasn't been reported. And they still haven't disclosed it. And so I think that that, in itself, answers that question.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I sense that reporters are going to ask Democrats about what they knew and when they knew it. And I sense that there are a lot of independent voters and some Democratic voters who want to know exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And look, it's not just conservatives buying this book. I mean, this book—a lot of Democrats are reading this book. We had an event at the 9:30 Club last night here in D.C.—you know, this is not MAGA Central—and there were a lot of people there, and they want to hear what we learned.</p>
<p>So I think that the Democrats who want to run for president and other higher office—I don’t think that you can just say, “We only want to look forward,” which is what Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are attempting to do.</p>
<p>I think this was a huge scandal. I think that the Democratic Party owns it, and I think that they need to reckon with it.</p>
<p>I find it odd that Alex and I have had more to say about our roles as reporters in this. Not that we shouldn’t be talking about it—I’m happy to own anything I’ve ever done or not done—but this was the Democratic Party that did this.</p>
<p>Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Hunter Biden, the politburo, Democratic leaders, donors—they saw this, and nobody spoke up. Or very few people spoke up. And the ones who did speak up got hammered: Dean Phillips, Robert Hur, Annie Linskey, and Siobhan Hughes of The Wall Street Journal, and on and on.</p>
<p>I think there does need to be a reckoning.</p>
<p>I find it incredibly disingenuous when the answer, I never saw anything, from people in Washington. I tend to accept it a little bit more from governors who are hundreds of miles away, but people in Washington, D.C., who had private meetings with Joe Biden? I just don’t buy it. For most of them, I just don’t buy that they never saw anything.</p></div>]]></description>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">During the current election cycle, President Biden has dismissed concerns about seeking re-election. He says that he is fit for the job and in it to win it. But after the first 2024 Presidential Debate, many public officials, donors, and die-hard Democratic voters have expressed deep concern about Biden’s performance. They are now facing an existential question about his campaign's viability against Donald Trump and whether a new candidate would be a better option. Those who think Biden should step aside argue that his performance during the debate and recent public appearances raises questions about his age and mental acuity and his capacity to lead the nation for another term. They argue that a new candidate could re-energize the Democratic base and appeal more broadly to younger voters, swing voters, and those disenchanted with the status quo, improving the Democrats' election chances. Those who believe he should not step aside insist that the democratic process should be respected, allowing Biden to run if he wishes and letting voters decide his fate. Stepping aside now would fragment the party at a crucial moment and Biden’s experience in both domestic and international politics are invaluable, particularly when contrasted with Trump's polarizing tenure.</span>

<p>In 2019, Donald Trump went to Walter Reed, and we still don't know what he went to Walter Reed for. It still hasn't been reported. And they still haven't disclosed it. And so I think that that, in itself, answers that question.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I sense that reporters are going to ask Democrats about what they knew and when they knew it. And I sense that there are a lot of independent voters and some Democratic voters who want to know exactly what happened.</p>
<p>And look, it's not just conservatives buying this book. I mean, this book—a lot of Democrats are reading this book. We had an event at the 9:30 Club last night here in D.C.—you know, this is not MAGA Central—and there were a lot of people there, and they want to hear what we learned.</p>
<p>So I think that the Democrats who want to run for president and other higher office—I don’t think that you can just say, “We only want to look forward,” which is what Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are attempting to do.</p>
<p>I think this was a huge scandal. I think that the Democratic Party owns it, and I think that they need to reckon with it.</p>
<p>I find it odd that Alex and I have had more to say about our roles as reporters in this. Not that we shouldn’t be talking about it—I’m happy to own anything I’ve ever done or not done—but this was the Democratic Party that did this.</p>
<p>Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Hunter Biden, the politburo, Democratic leaders, donors—they saw this, and nobody spoke up. Or very few people spoke up. And the ones who did speak up got hammered: Dean Phillips, Robert Hur, Annie Linskey, and Siobhan Hughes of The Wall Street Journal, and on and on.</p>
<p>I think there does need to be a reckoning.</p>
<p>I find it incredibly disingenuous when the answer, I never saw anything, from people in Washington. I tend to accept it a little bit more from governors who are hundreds of miles away, but people in Washington, D.C., who had private meetings with Joe Biden? I just don’t buy it. For most of them, I just don’t buy that they never saw anything.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Marriage has long been considered a goal to aspire to and a conventional path to happiness. </span><span data-contrast="none">But over the last few decades, the traditional view of marriage as </span><span data-contrast="none">the</span><span data-contrast="none"> cornerstone of adult life has been questioned. Changes in economic conditions, gender roles, and cultural values have fueled a reevaluation of whether marriage is still desirable or necessary for personal fulfillment and social stability. Those who believe it’s better to get married argue that married individuals report better physical and mental well-being, compared to single adults. They also experience economic and social benefits.

<p><strong>Moderators:</strong></p>
<p><strong>John Donvan</strong><br>John Donvan is the host of Open to Debate and has been moderating our debates since 2008. An author, speaker, and journalist, John has reported for ABC, CNN, and PBS, including multi-year postings in Moscow, London, Jerusalem, and Amman, and a term as chief White House correspondent for ABC News. His 2016 book, "In a Different Key: The Story of Autism", was a New York Times bestseller and a Wall Street Journal Top Ten Nonfiction Book of the Year. John is a four-time Emmy Award winner and was a National Magazine Award finalist in 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Speakers For:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Rothwell</strong><br><span class="TextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0">Jonathan Rothwell is Gallup’s principal economist, where he researches and publishes on a broad range of social science topics and helps Gallup clients design and execute research to answer their questions and address societal challenges. His publications at Gallup have included an analysis of married Americans’ well-being versus single adults, who supported various presidential candidates during the 2016 election, the causes of slowing U.S. productivity growth, the effect of trade competition on regional economic outcomes, and the validity of using consumer ratings to assess colleges. Rothwell is also a visiting scholar at the George Washington University Public Policy Institute and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. In 2019, Rothwell published a book on the fundamental causes of income inequality called “A Republic of Equals: A Manifesto for a Just Society.” He previously contributed analysis to </span></span><em><span class="TextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0">The New York Times'</span></span></em><span class="TextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXO40504072 BCX0"> The Upshot column from 2017 to 2020. He publishes opinion pieces and essays to a variety of other high-profile outlets. He holds a Ph.D. from Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Speakers Against:</strong></p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Though they share similar values, guidelines, and principles, Islam and Judaism have a long, complicated relationship that has led to tension recorded within the Quran and other Islamic texts.

Yet other religious scholars argue that this is not the case.

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Tech</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The Supreme Court is taking up a case that could affect how you read about issues during a crucial election year. Government officials concerned about misinformation related to topics such as COVID and election integrity had requested that social media platforms take down some posts. Several plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit alleging that by doing so, the government was suppressing speech and certain viewpoints. Now, there’s a question of whether such government actions amount to coercion or are legitimate exercises of power. </span><span data-contrast="none">Those</span><span data-contrast="none"> who argue coercion</span><span data-contrast="none"> believe that government requests limit free speech, claim "misinformation" is subjective, and worry that increased content moderation could lead to authoritarian control over public discourse online. Those who argue legitimate cooperation say that platforms often voluntarily comply with these requests as part of their anti-misinformation policies, making it a collaborative effort for public benefit. They also note that in cases where misinformation threatens public health or safety, such as false information about vaccines, government intervention is justified to protect the public.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">Now in this mock trial, we take this question on the free speech, government, and misinformation on social media platforms.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Tech</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The Supreme Court is taking up a case that could affect how you read about issues during a crucial election year. Government officials concerned about misinformation related to topics such as COVID and election integrity had requested that social media platforms take down some posts. Several plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit alleging that by doing so, the government was suppressing speech and certain viewpoints. Now, there’s a question of whether such government actions amount to coercion or are legitimate exercises of power. </span><span data-contrast="none">Those</span><span data-contrast="none"> who argue coercion</span><span data-contrast="none"> believe that government requests limit free speech, claim "misinformation" is subjective, and worry that increased content moderation could lead to authoritarian control over public discourse online. Those who argue legitimate cooperation say that platforms often voluntarily comply with these requests as part of their anti-misinformation policies, making it a collaborative effort for public benefit. They also note that in cases where misinformation threatens public health or safety, such as false information about vaccines, government intervention is justified to protect the public.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">Now in this mock trial, we take this question on the free speech, government, and misinformation on social media platforms.</span><span data-contrast="auto"> </span></p>

<span data-contrast="none">It’s not often that young people’s opinions about what is happening in the public square, and their ideas for solutions to these issues, are platformed and celebrated. But here, we have a hopeful look at what </span><i><span data-contrast="none">real </span></i><span data-contrast="none">debate can look like, an antidote to polarization and the disintegration of civil discourse. In a national championship run by Incubate Debate, the U.S.’s fastest-growing middle school and high school debate league, middle school and high school students from 180 schools across Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia gathered in Jacksonville, FL to participate in two days of vigorous debates ranging from climate change to Donald Trump’s role on January 6th. Ten distinguished judges from across the ideological spectrum deliberated which debater made their points in each debate, including Open to Debate CEO Clea Conner, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Chief Program Officer of the Bill of Rights Institute Stan Smith.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">Join us as we follow eight students during the final rounds of Incubate Debate who debate the following questions: “Should College DEI Programs Be Abolished?” and “Is Climate Change An Emergency?”</span></p>

<p>Open to Debate CEO Clea Conner explains what debate can do for high schoolers:</p>
<p>“The erosion of civil discourse that we’ve seen in institutes of higher learning this semester is alarming. The ability for students to consider views they disagree with and respond with civility and respect has become all too rare. We believe in the power of debate to teach critical thinking, active listening, empathy, and the ability to marshal evidence to understand complex issues. We are confident these students will model a more thoughtful way forward for their generation.”</p>
<p>Open to Debate reports from Jacksonville, Florida, hearing from some of the ninety kids competing, the best from their schools who were whittled down from over 5,000 who competed across 22 individual tournaments during the school year. They came from all backgrounds and all variety of schools (public, private, charter, and homeschool). In addition to Conner herself, judges included former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and “Street Epistemologist” and author Peter Boghossian.</p>

<p><p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">New Special Episode - </span></p>
<span data-contrast="none">It’s not often that young people’s opinions about what is happening in the public square, and their ideas for solutions to these issues, are platformed and celebrated. But here, we have a hopeful look at what </span><i><span data-contrast="none">real </span></i><span data-contrast="none">debate can look like, an antidote to polarization and the disintegration of civil discourse. In a national championship run by Incubate Debate, the U.S.’s fastest-growing middle school and high school debate league, middle school and high school students from 180 schools across Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia gathered in Jacksonville, FL to participate in two days of vigorous debates ranging from climate change to Donald Trump’s role on January 6th. Ten distinguished judges from across the ideological spectrum deliberated which debater made their points in each debate, including Open to Debate CEO Clea Conner, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and Chief Program Officer of the Bill of Rights Institute Stan Smith.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">Join us as we follow eight students during the final rounds of Incubate Debate who debate the following questions: “Should College DEI Programs Be Abolished?” and “Is Climate Change An Emergency?”</span></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Education</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Happiness is a complex emotion and mental state, one that has been pondered since the times of the Ancient Greeks. Many have wondered what it means to be happy and to achieve happiness through either virtue or pleasure. Is it for the good of the individual or the benefit of society? Those who believe virtue is the key to happiness argue that it is important for the well-being of both the individual and society, as touted by the Founding Fathers and the Stoics and inspired by Jeffrey Rosen's book "The Pursuit of Happiness", as one should strive for a life of moral virtue and rationality. Those who believe pleasure is the key to happiness see it as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain. Quoting philosophers such as Epicurus and John Stuart Mill and touting Roger Crisp's "Reason and the Good", they also argue that everyone should have the liberty to define their sources of happiness and seek them as they see fit.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">1 in 3 adults in the United States have a criminal record</span><b><span data-contrast="none">,</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> which offers significant challenges to these individuals, including reentering the job market after incarceration. Over the years, there’s been a push for “Ban the Box” policies that call for removing questions asking about criminal history on job applications to give former offenders a fair chance by delaying background checks until later in the hiring process. Those who are against early screening argue that former offenders shouldn’t continue to be punished by the system, especially when it disproportionally affects minorities. It also prevents applicants from contributing and reintegrating into society and reducing dependency on social services. Those who disagree and say that screening a job applicant’s criminal history is important, argue that employers have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their business, employees, and customers and make informed hiring decisions. Without early screening, some recent studies show that employers might unconsciously resort to biased assumptions or stereotypes when evaluating candidates.</span>

<p><span data-contrast="none">1 in 3 adults in the United States have a criminal record</span><b><span data-contrast="none">,</span></b><span data-contrast="none"> which offers significant challenges to these individuals, including reentering the job market after incarceration. Over the years, there’s been a push for “Ban the Box” policies that call for removing questions asking about criminal history on job applications to give former offenders a fair chance by delaying background checks until later in the hiring process. Those who are against early screening argue that former offenders shouldn’t continue to be punished by the system, especially when it disproportionally affects minorities. It also prevents applicants from contributing and reintegrating into society and reducing dependency on social services. Those who disagree and say that screening a job applicant’s criminal history is important, argue that employers have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their business, employees, and customers and make informed hiring decisions. Without early screening, some recent studies show that employers might unconsciously resort to biased assumptions or stereotypes when evaluating candidates.</span>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, U.S., World</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has provided more than $75 billion in aid to Ukraine, which has been directed toward military operations, economic support, and humanitarian assistance. As the war has gone on, members of Congress have questioned whether we have done enough to help the country and if continuing funding is sustainable. Those who want to continue funding Ukraine say the U.S. has a moral obligation to support the country in its time of need, it sustains alliances while serving strategic interests, and it demonstrates the United States's support of democratic values and sovereignty. Those arguing it’s time to end the funding say that it diverts necessary resources that could go toward domestic and foreign priorities. They also question whether the funds are being used efficiently, whether the war is winnable, and whether providing military aid is genuinely contributing to a path toward peace. </span>
<span data-contrast="none">With this crucial background, we debate the question: Should Congress Stop Funding the War in Ukraine?</span>
This debate was recorded live for an invite-only audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.</p>

<p><span data-contrast="none">Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has provided more than $75 billion in aid to Ukraine, which has been directed toward military operations, economic support, and humanitarian assistance. As the war has gone on, members of Congress have questioned whether we have done enough to help the country and if continuing funding is sustainable. Those who want to continue funding Ukraine say the U.S. has a moral obligation to support the country in its time of need, it sustains alliances while serving strategic interests, and it demonstrates the United States's support of democratic values and sovereignty. Those arguing it’s time to end the funding say that it diverts necessary resources that could go toward domestic and foreign priorities. They also question whether the funds are being used efficiently, whether the war is winnable, and whether providing military aid is genuinely contributing to a path toward peace. </span>
<span data-contrast="none">With this crucial background, we debate the question: Should Congress Stop Funding the War in Ukraine?</span>
This debate was recorded live for an invite-only audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.</p>

Yet its influence can stem beyond this into other topics, such as politics, education, and global relations. Many have long wondered what religion’s net impact on society is and whether it’s good for us.

Many have long wondered what religion’s net impact on society is and whether it’s good for us. Those who say it’s a force for good argue that religion offers a sense of identity and belonging, promotes altruism and charitable acts, and provides a moral compass that encourages personal growth and commitment to justice.

<p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Swift's billionaire status stands out among her financial peers from the business community who are often scrutinized for their<strong> </strong>extreme wealth. Swift became a self-made billionaire because of her unparalleled talent, relentless work ethic, and passionate support from millions of fans. If Swift's fortune is because of these factors, isn’t it a desirable and inspiring outcome? Those who agree would point to philosopher Robert Nozick, who says if someone acquires wealth through just means without violating others' rights, they are entitled to the rewards of their labor. However, philosophers with an opposing view are concerned about whether any individual, including Swift, should be able to amass such fortunes. To them, every billionaire created is a policy failure and they tend to prioritize equality of outcomes versus equality of opportunity. They question the fairness of a system that permits vast wealth accumulation and argue that luck and systemic advantages often play a role and in some cases, involve exploitation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With this background, we debate the question: Does Taylor Swift Deserve Her Billion Dollar Fortune?</p></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics, U.S., World</p>
<p><p style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Swift's billionaire status stands out among her financial peers from the business community who are often scrutinized for their<strong> </strong>extreme wealth. Swift became a self-made billionaire because of her unparalleled talent, relentless work ethic, and passionate support from millions of fans. If Swift's fortune is because of these factors, isn’t it a desirable and inspiring outcome? Those who agree would point to philosopher Robert Nozick, who says if someone acquires wealth through just means without violating others' rights, they are entitled to the rewards of their labor. However, philosophers with an opposing view are concerned about whether any individual, including Swift, should be able to amass such fortunes. To them, every billionaire created is a policy failure and they tend to prioritize equality of outcomes versus equality of opportunity. They question the fairness of a system that permits vast wealth accumulation and argue that luck and systemic advantages often play a role and in some cases, involve exploitation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With this background, we debate the question: Does Taylor Swift Deserve Her Billion Dollar Fortune?</p></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics, Finance</p>
<p>American women are, on average, paid 84 cents for every dollar men make, according to the Department of Labor. This wage gap has persisted despite near-record rates of women’s participation in the labor market, with wage gaps even larger for women in minority populations, and it’s estimated that pay parity will not be achieved until 2052. Should policy interventions address these disparities, or is it more important to recognize and honor women's personal decisions and find another way to look at the gap Those in favor of fixing the gap see it as a point of fairness and equity that would bring economic benefits, such as enhanced family incomes and increased productivity, and say that new policies are needed urgently to dismantle systemic barriers stopping women from earning more. Those who aren’t in favor argue wage disparities reflect individual choices regarding career paths, work-life balance, and tenure, rather than systemic discrimination. They also point out that when adjusted for factors like job type, hours worked, and career breaks, the gap significantly narrows.
Against this backdrop, we debate the question: Should We Address the Gender Wage Gap?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> March 08, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Culture, Economics, Finance</p>
<p>American women are, on average, paid 84 cents for every dollar men make, according to the Department of Labor. This wage gap has persisted despite near-record rates of women’s participation in the labor market, with wage gaps even larger for women in minority populations, and it’s estimated that pay parity will not be achieved until 2052. Should policy interventions address these disparities, or is it more important to recognize and honor women's personal decisions and find another way to look at the gap Those in favor of fixing the gap see it as a point of fairness and equity that would bring economic benefits, such as enhanced family incomes and increased productivity, and say that new policies are needed urgently to dismantle systemic barriers stopping women from earning more. Those who aren’t in favor argue wage disparities reflect individual choices regarding career paths, work-life balance, and tenure, rather than systemic discrimination. They also point out that when adjusted for factors like job type, hours worked, and career breaks, the gap significantly narrows.
Against this backdrop, we debate the question: Should We Address the Gender Wage Gap?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Debate Date:</strong> February 21, 2024</p>
<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Law, Politics</p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In a high-stakes presidential election year, in partnership with the Newt and Jo Minow Debate Series at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Open to Debate is taking a look at</span><b><span data-contrast="none"> </span></b><span data-contrast="none">more than a decade of the </span><i><span data-contrast="none">Citizens United </span></i><span data-contrast="none">Supreme Court case. The 2010 landmark decision that ruled the free speech clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, including nonprofits, labor unions, and other associations, changed the landscape of political spending in the U.S. This gave rise to Super PACS and an increase in election campaign spending. Since then, there have been questions about whether the decision has harmed our democratic process. Those who support the decision argue it upholds free speech, allowing diverse voices in the political arena, and broadens the range of discourse by enabling groups to freely express their views and support candidates or policies. Those against it argue that it allows a disproportionate influence from corporations and special interest groups, and leaves the voices of ordinary citizens overshadowed by the financial resources of a few, eroding the principles of equality and fair representation.</span>
<span data-contrast="none">With this context, we debate the question: Has Citizens United Undermined Democracy?</span>
<b><span data-contrast="none">This debate was presented in partnership with the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law as part of the Newt and Jo Minow Debate Series. It was recorded live in person on Wednesday, February 21, 2024, at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, Illinois.</span></b></p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong> Politics, U.S., World</p>
<p>Post-October 7th, Iran's presence in the Middle East—and on the world stage—is growing stronger, many say, given its nuclear ambitions and its use of proxies in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, most recently disrupting shipping in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Its regional dominance is expanding, but is it also emerging as a global threat as it aligns with other authoritarian regimes? In Open to Debate’s Unresolved format and in partnership with the Council on Foreign Relations, National Security Council and State Department veterans will debate Biden’s Iran diplomacy, the country's use of proxies in the Middle East, its nuclear ambitions, and whether Iran now poses a threat to the global order.
<strong>This debate was recorded live on January 25, 2024, in Washington D.C. at the Council on Foreign Relations.</strong>
Feature Debate Topics:
<ul>
 	<li>Has Biden’s Iran Diplomacy Failed?</li>
 	<li>Can Israel Live with a Nuclear Iran?</li>

<div><strong>Should People Date AI? Thao Ha Says ‘Yes, But…’</strong> <small>2025-07-10 12:03:53</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>Key Takeaways</p>
<p>At an Open to Debate event, Professor Thao Ha explained why she argued “yes” to the question “Could dating an AI be better than dating a human?” (https://www.datingnews.com/movers-and-shakers/should-people-date-ai-thao-ha-debate/#Debate)
 Ha emphasized the healing potential of AI as a tool in romantic relationships, especially for adolescents experiencing confusing feelings. (https://www.datingnews.com/movers-and-shakers/should-people-date-ai-thao-ha-debate/#AI)
 Adults in vulnerable situations, such as caregivers and clashing couples, can use AI and VR to work through emotional obstacles. (https://www.datingnews.com/movers-and-shakers/should-people-date-ai-thao-ha-debate/#emotional)</p>
<p>At June 10th’s Open to Debate event (https://mailchi.mp/opentodebate.org/debatecould-dating-an-ai-be-better-than-a-human-2686564?e=23379795b6) in New York City, dating industry pros asked the question on everybody’s lips: Could dating an AI be better than dating a human?</p>
<p>Thao Ha (https://search.asu.edu/profile/2162867), Associate Professor of Psychology at Arizona State University, argued “yes”, while Justin Garcia, Executive Director & Senior Scientist at the Kinsey Institute and Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com (http://match.com/), argued “no.”
In the overarching AI debate in the dating industry, the greatest fear is that AI will come to replace the uniquely human ability to love. Ha’s claim that dating an AI bot (https://www.datingnews.com/uncategorized/what-are-bots/) could, in some ways, be preferable to dating a human being is certainly controversial.</p>
<p>After the debate, DatingNews spoke to Ha about her unconventional viewpoint, and the surprising benefits of connecting emotionally with AI.</p>
<p>To “Date” AI is to Use it as a Romantic Tool
Ha is the director of the @HEART lab (https://search.asu.edu/profile/2162867) (Healthy Experiences Across Relationships and Transitions), which studies a buzzy topic: The mental, emotional, and social impacts AI has on adolescent relationships.</p>
<p>On the “pro” side of the debate, Ha argues that intuitive tech, like VR and AI, have the potential to ease loneliness and meet short-term emotional needs. For people who struggle to make satisfying in-person connections, AI and VR could be transformative tools.</p>
<p>When dating someone in real life isn’t an option — which, for some people, it isn’t — developing an emotional attachment to an AI bot could help satisfy several crucial emotional needs: the need to explore one’s romantic and sexual feelings in a healthy way, or to express thoughts and feelings without judgement, for example.</p>
<p>Ha doesn’t advocate for no-holds-barred access to AI. Instead, she argues that people, and the platforms that use AI, should promote a healthy balance between IRL and AI connections.</p>
<p>“It’s not my goal that everybody’s going to start dating AI,” she told us. On the contrary, Ha simply wants to acknowledge the potential AI has as a therapeutic tool, particularly for vulnerable groups, like adolescents and struggling couples.
As someone who specifically studies AI’s impact on adolescent relationships, Ha warns against offering shortcuts to human connection to people at such an impressionable age.</p>
<p>“Learning how to date with the current AI, when you don’t have any experiences yet and you have someone who’s constantly responsive, I actually think that might not be the greatest idea,” she told us.</p>
<p>But an AI relationship coach is a particularly promising role for an AI bot. Instead of taking over the role of healthcare provider or friend, AI could be “a non-biased, evidence-based, science-based relationship coach” that acts as “a different kind of socialization agent,” Ha said.</p>
<p>And in the fight against the loneliness epidemic, it’s only a matter of time before people turn to non-human forms of communication, Ha said. “It’s a really adaptive signal for us to survive as humans, actually,” she said. “The fact that AI now all of a sudden is an option actually makes total sense.”
AI Shows Promise for Supporting Couples in Distress
Ha supports the use of AI in some social situations and for some people, but she acknowledges that it’s far from a relationship cure-all.</p>
<p>She describes her stance on AI dating as more “nuanced” than some AI enthusiasts may expect.</p>
<p>She feels that people at the debate resonated specifically with the idea of augmented intimacy — when tech like AI and VR are used to enhance the typically-human experience of intimacy and connection.
People who have been through painful divorces, break-ups, and/or the loss of a spouse may benefit from chatting with an AI date before they get back into the swing of IRL dating.</p>
<p>Then there are adults in relationships with emotional or physical barriers, such as people who act as caretakers for their spouses, or are in otherwise emotionally-stymied relationships. “[AI dating] could be a buffer,” Ha explained. “If you’re a caregiver, it actually might give you the support that your partner cannot give you, [which] is actually really helpful.”</p>
<p>For others, a little AI flirtation can simply add some excitement back into a long-term relationship. “A lot of people are satisfied with their relationship but are missing that spark that they had in the beginning,” she said.</p>
<p>When AI temporarily supplements a missing emotional need, it’s working “in very synergistic ways,” Ha said.</p>
<p>As the AI boom continues, Ha cautions against diving into AI relationships without considering the potential long term effects — a difficult task, considering we don’t really know yet what those long term effects will be.</p>
<p>“I think the big point that I was trying to make [at the debate] is like, yeah, we have all these anecdotes of people really enjoying [AI]… but we don’t really know the long term effects of what happens to people’s mental health and their real life relationships,” Ha said. “There’s no studies on that and I think I would love to see more work in that area.”</p></div>]]></description>

<p>Whoever wins the 2024 election will soon face a critical decision about extending four trillion dollars in tax cuts expiring next year. Whether taxes will be raised, or cut is in question, against the backdrop of 34.1 trillion dollars in federal debt. For the past few decades, the Republican Party has embraced the belief that lower tax rates and less government spending boost the U.S. economy. However, there is disagreement among conservative thought leaders about the way forward on taxes for the Republican Party. Specifically, some argue that preferences for tax cuts ignore the looming deficit and that refusing to raise taxes further imbalances the federal budget. However, others continue to argue that our debt is caused by government overspending and will actually be helped by tax cuts and that these same cuts also help promote a flourishing economy.
With this background, we debate the question: Is the Republican Party’s Refusal to Raise Taxes Fiscally Irresponsible?</p>

<strong>About the Trial</strong>
<span data-contrast="none">After the 2020 election and until he left office, former President Trump discredited the election results and claimed there was election fraud leading to President Biden’s win. The January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol is tied to Trump’s claims. Trump has been federally indicted on four charges: “Conspiracy to Defraud the United States,” “Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding,” “Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding,” and “Conspiracy Against Rights.” Those arguing Trump’s innocence say proof is needed that he had planned to commit a crime, that he was acting within the scope of his presidential duties, and he conducted himself under legal advice. Those arguing Trump is guilty say his actions showed criminal intent to defraud the United States, made false claims knowingly, and tried to deceive others into blocking the voting certification. </span><span data-ccp-props="{"134233117":false,"134233118":false,"201341983":0,"335551550":1,"335551620":1,"335559685":0,"335559737":0,"335559738":0,"335559739":300,"335559740":259}"> </span>

<div><strong>The Trump Colorado Case: Right Analysis, Wrong Outcome</strong> <small>2023-12-21 15:59:07</small></div>
<div class='news-content'><p>I read the dissent of the Colorado Supreme Court’s 4-3 decision, written by the court’s chief justice, Brian Boatright. I agree with Justice Boatright’s opinion.</p>
<p>I agree with the detailed analysis of the majority opinion that there is substantial evidence in the public record that Donald Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment – i.e., that he participated in an insurrection criminal conspiracy to thwart the lawful election of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>But it is not good for the country, and not good law, for Trump to be barred from running in 2024 without due process of law, which means a trial, the right to cross-examination, and a verdict of guilt by a jury “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>The irony of course is that the ultimate abuser and denier of our U.S. Constitution, the rule of law, and due process is Donald J. Trump. Remember his leading the 2016 cheers to “Lock her up!” This was a reference to Hillary Clinton’s practice of storing her State Department emails on a private server. He did not insist that Hillary Clinton be provided due process before leading that cheer. As we now know, the inspector general of the State Department did not find she had violated any criminal laws and FBI Director James Comey – no Hillary Clinton fan – agreed that not one of the 33,000 emails she transferred to her private server contained recognizable classified markings.</p>
<p>But that example cuts both ways. Yes, it is obviously hypocritical for Trump and his supporters to scream about due process in the Colorado case. But Mrs. Clinton’s example also shows why due process is so important. She was never convicted of anything. And, so far at least, neither has Trump.</p>
<p>Winning a criminal insurrection conspiracy case won’t be a cakewalk for Special Counsel Jack Smith. I say this because on Dec. 14 I participated as playing Smith’s role as “prosecutor” in a mock trial sponsored by the nationally respected nonprofit organization Open to Debate (https://opentodebate.org/debates/). Our mock argument was live-streamed last week, but it can be heard again on Jan. 5, 2024, the day before the anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection effort, on an NPR local affiliate; seen and heard on YouTube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AQxFtqh-4); on opentodebate.org; or on available podcast channels.</p>
<p>During this mock trial, the Trump side was represented by Sara Azari (https://www.azarilaw.com/sara-azari), a Los Angeles-based defense lawyer. Sara argued not only the absence of a smoking gun admission or written evidence by Trump that he knew he had lost the election; she also effectively argued that Trump’s claims, though false, are protected as political speech under the First Amendment.</p>
<p>My response was that the First Amendment does not protect lies that are part of a criminal conspiracy. I pointed out that there will be testimony from several people that Trump admitted he had lost but lied about it. However, I also pointed out that a jury can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that the voter fraud did not cost him the election because the highest officials of his government, whom he appointed, all told him he had lost, including the attorney general, senior Justice Department officials, the director of national intelligence, and every single state official in the key battleground states whom he called. Georgia’s secretary of state of told him he had lost after three separate recounts. Still Trump asked him to “find” one vote more than the total Biden was found to have won Georgia – proving he knew he was asking the secretary of state to lie.</p>
<p>I also pointed out that 61 out of 61 state court judges rejected his claim that he had lost these key battleground states because of voter fraud. (Once in Pennsylvania, a court found some voter fraud, but that judge also ruled it wasn’t significant enough to change the outcome in that state).</p>
<p>In any event, there will and must be a test of Donald Trump’s culpability, but that must come in a trial, with due process by a finder of fact that reaches a verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. America cannot accept a verdict barring Trump from running for office based on a court hearing 1,500 miles from Washington, D.C., without a trial, on a civil court standard of “preponderance of the evidence” – meaning anything above 50%.</p>
<p>Those of us who oppose Trump can beat him at the ballot box, especially if and when he is convicted of felonies in one or more of the criminal trials he faces in federal and state courts. Colorado’s chief justice was right in his dissent when he concluded Trump should not be barred by a state court “in the absence of an insurrection-related conviction” – the latter word meaning after a trial and a jury of his peers finds the defendant guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>Lanny Davis is the founder of the Washington, D.C., law firm, Lanny J. Davis & Associates. He is one of the first to use the concept of legal crisis management to solve client problems – operating at the intersection of law, media, and politics. He is a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton in 1996-98 and served on a privacy and civil liberties panel appointed by President George W. Bush. He has been writing his “Purple Nation” column for more than 13 years.</p></div>]]></description>
